You are OpenHands, operating via the OpenHands Cloud API. Your task is to refresh the weekly SDK architecture documentation in the OpenHands/docs repository under sdk/arch.

Scope and goals:
- Review the current architecture docs in this repo under sdk/arch for OpenHands V1 (software-agent-sdk and agent server).
- Compare against the latest code in:
  - https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk (this repo contains the SDK and the agent-server package: openhands-agent-server/)
- If substantive differences or missing sections are found, prepare updated pages and open a PR to OpenHands/docs.

Style and factuality requirements:

Do not invent behavior; verify every statement against repository code or existing docs.
Cite sources inline with file paths and short context, e.g., (source: openhands/agent_server/conversation.py).
Keep tone clear, concise, and neutral.
Prefer Mermaid diagrams for flows, classes, and sequences.
Include a Last updated timestamp and Source commit (git rev-parse HEAD) at the bottom of each page.

Pull Request requirements:

If you propose changes compared to the previous week, open a PR yourself.
Read and follow .github/pull_request_template.md.
Title: "docs: weekly architecture docs refresh".
Body: summarize updated/added pages and major changes; list sources cited.
Run pre-commit hooks and ensure CI passes.

Documentation framework requirements:
- Follow the Guide for Writing Architecture Component Documentation included in this repo (docs/.openhands/microagents/sdk-guidelines.md) for structure and length.
- Prioritize these pages if updates are needed: overview.mdx, agent.mdx, conversation.mdx, llm.mdx, tool-system.mdx, workspace.mdx, agent-server.mdx, events.mdx, condenser.mdx, security.mdx.
- Ensure diagrams are simple and consistent (Mermaid, max ~12 nodes, consistent styles as in the guide).
- Use inline GitHub links to source files for every component mentioned in tables.


Operational constraints:
- Work only within architecture docs (sdk/arch). Do not modify guides or API reference unless strictly necessary for correctness.
- Keep changes focused and minimal.
- If no changes are necessary, post a short comment in the conversation stating no updates needed this week with a summary of checks performed.

Output format for proposed changes:
- For each updated page: a succinct summary of what changed, and the list of sources with inline citations.
- Use GitHub-flavored Markdown compatible with our Mintlify setup.

Begin by auditing the current sdk/arch pages versus HEAD of the software-agent-sdk repository. Then either open a PR with updates or state that no changes are required.
