# openhands.sdk.conversation module

### class BaseConversation

Bases: `ABC`

Abstract base class for conversation implementations.

This class defines the interface that all conversation implementations must follow.
Conversations manage the interaction between users and agents, handling message
exchange, execution control, and state management.


#### Properties

- ``: property confirmation_policy_active : bool
- ``: abstract property conversation_stats : [ConversationStats](openhands.sdk.conversation#class-conversationstats)
- ``: abstract property id : UUID
- ``: property is_confirmation_mode_active : bool
  Check if confirmation mode is active.
  Returns True if BOTH conditions are met:
  1. The agent has a security analyzer set (not None)
  2. The confirmation policy is active
- ``: abstract property state : ConversationStateProtocol

#### Methods

#### abstractmethod close()

#### static compose_callbacks()

* Parameters:
  * llm – Optional LLM to use for title generation. If not provided,
    uses the agent’s LLM.
  * max_length – Maximum length of the generated title.
* Returns:
  A generated title for the conversation.

#### abstractmethod update_secrets()

### class Conversation

### class Conversation

Bases: `object`

Factory class for creating conversation instances with OpenHands agents.

This factory automatically creates either a LocalConversation or RemoteConversation
based on the workspace type provided. LocalConversation runs the agent locally,
while RemoteConversation connects to a remote agent server.

* Returns:
  LocalConversation if workspace is local, RemoteConversation if workspace
  is remote.

#### Example

```pycon
from openhands.sdk import LLM, Agent, Conversation
llm = LLM(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514", api_key=SecretStr("key"))
agent = Agent(llm=llm, tools=[])
conversation = Conversation(agent=agent, workspace="./workspace")
conversation.send_message("Hello!")
conversation.run()
```

: reconcile agent, enforce id).

Else: create fresh (agent required), persist base, and return.

#### static get_unmatched_actions()

Find actions in the event history that don’t have matching observations.

This method identifies ActionEvents that don’t have corresponding
ObservationEvents or UserRejectObservations, which typically indicates
actions that are pending confirmation or execution.

* Parameters:
  events – List of events to search through
* Returns:
  List of ActionEvent objects that don’t have corresponding observations,
  in chronological order

#### locked()

Return True if the lock is currently held by any thread.

This is useful if you want to do some validation that requires the entire model to be initialized.

#### owned()

Return True if the lock is currently held by the calling thread.

#### release()

Release the lock.

* Raises:
  RuntimeError – If the current thread doesn’t own the lock.

#### set_on_state_change()

Provides Rich-formatted output with panels and complete content display.

#### Methods

#### __init__()

Initialize the visualizer.

* Parameters:
  * highlight_regex – Dictionary mapping regex patterns to Rich color styles
    for highlighting keywords in the visualizer.
    For example: (configuration object)

    scenarios where user input is not relevant to show.
  * conversation_stats – ConversationStats object to display metrics information.
  * name_for_visualization – Optional name to prefix in panel titles to identify
    which agent/conversation is speaking.

#### on_event()

    uses self.agent.llm.
  * max_length – Maximum length of the generated title.
* Returns:
  A generated title for the conversation.
* Raises:
  ValueError – If no user messages are found in the conversation.

#### pause()

Pause agent execution.

This method can be called from any thread to request that the agent
pause execution. The pause will take effect at the next iteration
of the run loop (between agent steps).

Note: If called during an LLM completion, the pause will not take
effect until the current LLM call completes.

#### reject_pending_actions()

Reject all pending actions from the agent.

This is a non-invasive method to reject actions between run() calls.
Also clears the agent_waiting_for_confirmation flag.

#### run()

Runs the conversation until the agent finishes.

In confirmation mode:
- First call: creates actions but doesn’t execute them, stops and waits
- Second call: executes pending actions (implicit confirmation)

In normal mode:
- Creates and executes actions immediately

Can be paused between steps

* Parameters:
  message – Either a string (which will be converted to a user message)
  or a Message object

Set the confirmation policy and store it in conversation state.

#### update_secrets()

Add secrets to the conversation.

* Parameters:
  secrets – Dictionary mapping secret keys to values or no-arg callables.
  SecretValue = str | Callable[[], str]. Callables are invoked lazily
  when a command references the secret key.

#### pause()

#### reject_pending_actions()

#### run()

Execute the agent to process messages and perform actions.

This method runs the agent until it finishes processing the current
message or reaches the maximum iteration limit.

#### send_message()

Send a message to the agent.

#### set_confirmation_policy()

Set the confirmation policy for the conversation.

#### property stuck_detector

Stuck detector for compatibility.
Not implemented for remote conversations.

#### update_secrets()

### class SecretRegistry

Bases: `OpenHandsModel`

Manages secrets and injects them into bash commands when needed.

The secret registry stores a mapping of secret keys to SecretSources
that retrieve the actual secret values. When a bash command is about to be
executed, it scans the command for any secret keys and injects the corresponding
environment variables.

Secret sources will redact / encrypt their sensitive values as appropriate when
serializing, depending on the content of the context. If a context is present
and contains a ‘cipher’ object, this is used for encryption. If it contains a
boolean ‘expose_secrets’ flag set to True, secrets are dunped in plain text.
Otherwise secrets are redacted.

Additionally, it tracks the latest exported values to enable consistent masking
even when callable secrets fail on subsequent calls.


#### Properties

- `model_config`: ClassVar[ConfigDict] = (configuration object)
  Configuration for the model, should be a dictionary conforming to [ConfigDict][pydantic.config.ConfigDict].
- `secret_sources`: dict[str, SecretSource]

#### Methods

#### find_secrets_in_text()

Find all secret keys mentioned in the given text.

* Parameters:
  text – The text to search for secret keys
* Returns:
  Set of secret keys found in the text

#### get_secrets_as_env_vars()

Get secrets that should be exported as environment variables for a command.

* Parameters:
  command – The bash command to check for secret references
* Returns:
  Dictionary of environment variables to export (key ->` value)

#### mask_secrets_in_output()

Mask secret values in the given text.

This method uses both the current exported values and attempts to get
fresh values from callables to ensure comprehensive masking.

* Parameters:
  text – The text to mask secrets in
* Returns:
  Text with secret values replaced by `<secret-hidden>`

#### model_post_init()

Override this method to perform additional initialization after __init__ and model_construct.
This is useful if you want to do some validation that requires the entire model to be initialized.

#### update_secrets()

Add or update secrets in the manager.

* Parameters:
  secrets – Dictionary mapping secret keys to either string values
  or callable functions that return string values

### class StuckDetector

Bases: `object`

Detects when an agent is stuck in repetitive or unproductive patterns.

This detector analyzes the conversation history to identify various stuck patterns:
1. Repeating action-observation cycles
2. Repeating action-error cycles
3. Agent monologue (repeated messages without user input)
4. Repeating alternating action-observation patterns
5. Context window errors indicating memory issues


#### Properties

- `state`: [ConversationState](#openhands.sdk.conversation.ConversationState)

#### Methods
