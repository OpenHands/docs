### class SecurityRisk

Bases: `str`, `Enum`

Security risk levels for actions.

Based on OpenHands security risk levels but adapted for agent-sdk.
Integer values allow for easy comparison and ordering.


#### Properties

- `description`: str ¶
  Get a human-readable description of the risk level.
- `visualize`: Text ¶
  Return Rich Text representation of this risk level.

#### Methods

#### HIGH = 'HIGH'¶

#### LOW = 'LOW'¶

#### MEDIUM = 'MEDIUM'¶

#### UNKNOWN = 'UNKNOWN'¶

#### get_color()

Get the color for displaying this risk level in Rich text.

#### is_riskier()

Check if this risk level is riskier than another.
Risk levels follow the natural ordering: LOW is less risky than MEDIUM, which is
less risky than HIGH. UNKNOWN is not comparable to any other level.
To make this act like a standard well-ordered domain, we reflexively consider
risk levels to be riskier than themselves. That is:
This can be disabled by setting the `reflexive` parameter to False.
* Parameters:
  * other ([SecurityRisk](#class-securityrisk)) – The other risk level to compare against.
  * `reflexive` – Whether the relationship is reflexive.
* Raises:
  ValueError – If either risk level is UNKNOWN.
