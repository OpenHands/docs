## Classes

### `AgentContext`

Central structure for managing prompt extension.

AgentContext unifies all the contextual inputs that shape how the system
extends and interprets user prompts. It combines both static environment
details and dynamic, user-activated extensions from skills.

Specifically, it provides:
- **Repository context / Repo Skills**: Information about the active codebase,
branches, and repo-specific instructions contributed by repo skills.
- **Runtime context**: Current execution environment (hosts, working
directory, secrets, date, etc.).
- **Conversation instructions**: Optional task- or channel-specific rules
that constrain or guide the agent’s behavior across the session.
- **Knowledge Skills**: Extensible components that can be triggered by user input
to inject knowledge or domain-specific guidance.

Together, these elements make AgentContext the primary container responsible
for assembling, formatting, and injecting all prompt-relevant context into
LLM interactions.

#### Methods

##### `get_system_message_suffix(self) -> str | None`

Get the system message with repo skill content and custom suffix.

Custom suffix can typically includes:
- Repository information (repo name, branch name, PR number, etc.)
- Runtime information (e.g., available hosts, current date)
- Conversation instructions (e.g., user preferences, task details)
- Repository-specific instructions (collected from repo skills)

##### `get_user_message_suffix(self, user_message: Message, skip_skill_names: list[str]) -> tuple[TextContent, list[str]] | None`

Augment the user’s message with knowledge recalled from skills.

This works by:
- Extracting the text content of the user message
- Matching skill triggers against the query
- Returning formatted knowledge and triggered skill names if relevant skills were triggered

### `View`

Linearly ordered view of events.

Produced by a condenser to indicate the included events are ready to process as LLM
input. Also contains fields with information from the condensation process to aid
in deciding whether further condensation is needed.

#### Methods

##### `most_recent_condensation(self) -> Condensation | None`

Return the most recent condensation, or None if no condensations exist.

##### `summary_event_index(self) -> int | None`

Return the index of the summary event, or None if no summary exists.

##### `summary_event(self) -> CondensationSummaryEvent | None`

Return the summary event, or None if no summary exists.

##### `filter_unmatched_tool_calls(events: list[LLMConvertibleEvent]) -> list[LLMConvertibleEvent]`

Filter out unmatched tool call events.

Removes ActionEvents and ObservationEvents that have tool_call_ids
but don't have matching pairs.

##### `from_events(events: Sequence[Event]) -> 'View'`

Create a view from a list of events, respecting the semantics of any
condensation events.
