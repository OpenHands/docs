## Does the agent SDK support parallel tool calling?

**Yes, the OpenHands SDK supports parallel tool calling by default.**

The SDK automatically handles parallel tool calls when the underlying LLM (like Claude or GPT-4) returns multiple tool calls in a single response. This allows agents to execute multiple independent actions simultaneously, improving efficiency.

### How it works

When the LLM generates multiple tool calls in parallel, each tool call is converted into an `ActionEvent`. The SDK uses a shared `llm_response_id` to group these related actions together:

1. **Grouping**: Multiple `ActionEvent`s with the same `llm_response_id` are grouped together
2. **Message combining**: They're combined into a single LLM message with multiple `tool_calls`
3. **Thought consolidation**: Only the first event's `thought`, `reasoning_content`, and `thinking_blocks` are included; subsequent events have empty thought fields

**Example:**
```python
ActionEvent(llm_response_id="abc123", thought="Let me check...", tool_call=tool1)
ActionEvent(llm_response_id="abc123", thought=[], tool_call=tool2)
# Combined into: Message(role="assistant", content="Let me check...", tool_calls=[tool1, tool2])
```

### Code references

The parallel tool calling implementation can be found in these key locations:

- **Event system architecture**: See [Events Architecture](/sdk/arch/events#event-types) for detailed explanation of how parallel function calling works
- **Event grouping logic**: The SDK groups ActionEvents by `llm_response_id` when converting events to LLM messages (see [`prepare_llm_messages` in utils.py](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/agent/utils.py))
- **Action creation**: Actions are created with shared `llm_response_id` in the [agent step method](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/agent/agent.py#L200-L300)
- **Event definitions**: [`ActionEvent` class](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/event/llm_convertible/action.py) includes the `llm_response_id` field
