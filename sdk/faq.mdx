## Does the agent SDK support parallel tool calling?

**Yes, the OpenHands SDK supports parallel tool calling by default.**

The SDK automatically handles parallel tool calls when the underlying LLM (like Claude or GPT-4) returns multiple tool calls in a single response. This allows agents to execute multiple independent actions simultaneously, improving efficiency.

<Accordion title="How it works" icon="gear">
When the LLM generates multiple tool calls in parallel, the SDK groups them using a shared `llm_response_id`:

```python
ActionEvent(llm_response_id="abc123", thought="Let me check...", tool_call=tool1)
ActionEvent(llm_response_id="abc123", thought=[], tool_call=tool2)
# Combined into: Message(role="assistant", content="Let me check...", tool_calls=[tool1, tool2])
```

Multiple `ActionEvent`s with the same `llm_response_id` are grouped together and combined into a single LLM message with multiple `tool_calls`. Only the first event's thought/reasoning is included.
</Accordion>

### Code references

The parallel tool calling implementation can be found in the [Events Architecture](/sdk/arch/events#event-types) for detailed explanation of how parallel function calling works, the [`prepare_llm_messages` in utils.py](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/agent/utils.py) which groups ActionEvents by `llm_response_id` when converting events to LLM messages, the [agent step method](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/agent/agent.py#L200-L300) where actions are created with shared `llm_response_id`, and the [`ActionEvent` class](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/event/llm_convertible/action.py) which includes the `llm_response_id` field.
