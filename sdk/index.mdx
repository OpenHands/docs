description: A clean, modular SDK for building AI agents. Core agent framework and production-ready tool implementations.
---

The [OpenHands SDK](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/agent-sdk) is a production-ready framework for building AI agents that interact with code and software systems. Built on modern software engineering principles—event sourcing, immutability, and type safety—it provides a robust foundation for both research and production deployments.

## Why OpenHands SDK?

### 🎯 Correctness & Reliability
- **Event-sourced architecture** for perfect reproducibility
- **Immutable state** eliminates entire classes of bugs
- **Type-safe APIs** catch errors at compile time
- **Time-travel debugging** via event replay

### 🛠️ Developer Experience
- **Stateless agents** are easy to test and compose
- **100+ LLM providers** via LiteLLM integration
- **Native MCP support** for thousands of tools
- **Clear, minimal API** with sensible defaults

### 🚀 Production Ready
- **Built-in REST/WebSocket server** with authentication
- **Container sandboxing** for secure execution
- **Auto context condensation** (60-70% token reduction)
- **Interactive debugging** via VNC, VSCode Web

### 📊 Research Friendly
- **Custom agents** for arbitrary reasoning strategies
- **LLM routing** for A/B testing
- **Event logs** for retrospective analysis
- **Microagents** for rapid prompt engineering

## Use Cases

The SDK enables a wide range of applications:

1. **Documentation Automation** - Agents that analyze code changes and update documentation
2. **SRE Assistants** - Debug production issues by analyzing logs and code together
3. **Data Processing** - Transform unstructured data into structured database entries
4. **Code Review Bots** - Automatically review PRs and suggest improvements
5. **Testing Automation** - Generate and maintain test suites
6. **DevOps Agents** - Automate deployment and infrastructure management

This SDK also powers [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands), an all-batteries-included coding agent with GUI, CLI, and API interfaces.

## Hello World Example

This is what it looks like to write a program with an OpenHands agent:

```python
import os
from pydantic import SecretStr
from openhands.sdk import LLM, Conversation
from openhands.sdk.preset.default import get_default_agent

# Configure LLM
api_key = os.getenv("LLM_API_KEY")
assert api_key is not None, "LLM_API_KEY environment variable is not set."
llm = LLM(
    model="openhands/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    api_key=SecretStr(api_key),
)

# Create agent with default tools and configuration
agent = get_default_agent(
    llm=llm,
    working_dir=os.getcwd(),
    cli_mode=True,  # Disable browser tools for CLI environments
)

# Create conversation, send a message, and run
conversation = Conversation(agent=agent)
conversation.send_message("Create a Python file that prints 'Hello, World!'")
conversation.run()
```

## Installation & Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [`uv` package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (version 0.8.13+)

### Acquire and Set an LLM API Key

Obtain an API key from your favorite LLM provider, any [provider supported by LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers)
is supported by the Agent SDK, although we have a set of [recommended models](/openhands/usage/llms/llms) that
work well with OpenHands agents.

If you want to get started quickly, you can sign up for the [OpenHands Cloud](https://app.all-hands.dev) and go to the
[API key page](https://app.all-hands.dev/settings/api-keys), which allows you to use most of our recommended models
with no markup -- documentation is [here](/openhands/usage/llms/openhands-llms).

Once you do this, you can `export LLM_API_KEY=xxx` to use all the examples.

### Setup

Once this is done, run the following to do a Hello World example.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/agent-sdk.git
cd agent-sdk

# Install dependencies and setup development environment
make build

# Verify installation
uv run python examples/01_hello_world.py
```

## Key Concepts

### Event Sourcing

All state is derived from an immutable event log, enabling:
- Perfect reproducibility
- Time-travel debugging
- Complete audit trails
- Zero race conditions

```python
# State is derived, not stored
state = ConversationState()
state.append_event(event1)
state.append_event(event2)

# Same events → same state, always
assert state.agent_execution_status == compute_status(event1, event2)
```

### Stateless Agents

Agents are pure functions with no internal state:
- Easy to test (no mocking)
- Easy to serialize (send over network)
- Easy to scale (run anywhere)
- Easy to compose (sub-agents)

```python
class Agent:
    def step(self, state: ConversationState) -> Generator[Event]:
        # Read state (never modify!)
        # Generate actions
        # No internal state!
```

### Immutable Configuration

All configuration is frozen after creation:
- No config drift
- Type-safe at compile time
- Easy to version control
- Clear dependencies

```python
agent = Agent(llm=llm, tools=tools)  # Frozen
# To change, create new instance
new_agent = agent.model_copy(update={"llm": new_llm})
```
