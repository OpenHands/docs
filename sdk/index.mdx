The OpenHands Agent SDK is a set of Python and REST APIs for building **agents that work with code**.

You can use the OpenHands Agent SDK for:

- One-off tasks, like building a README for your repo
- Routine maintenance tasks, like updating dependencies
- Major tasks that involve multiple agents, like refactors and rewrites

You can even use the SDK to build new developer experiences—it’s the engine behind the [OpenHands CLI](/openhands/usage/how-to/cli-mode) and [OpenHands Cloud](/openhands/usage/cloud/openhands-cloud).

## Why OpenHands Agent SDK?

### Emphasis on coding

While other agent SDKs (e.g. [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/agents/)) are focused on more general use cases, like delivering chat-based support or automating back-office tasks, OpenHands is purpose-built for software engineering.

While some folks do use OpenHands to solve more general tasks (code is a powerful tool!), most of us use OpenHands to work with code.

### State-of-the-Art Performance

OpenHands is a top performer across a wide variety of benchmarks, including SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and multi-SWE-bench. The SDK includes a number of state-of-the-art agentic features developed by our research team, including:

- Task planning and decomposition
- Automatic context compression
- Security analysis
- Strong agent-computer interfaces

OpenHands has attracted researchers from a wide variety of academic institutions, and is [becoming the preferred harness](https://x.com/Alibaba_Qwen/status/1947766835023335516) for evaluating LLMs on coding tasks.

### Free and Open Source

OpenHands is also the leading open source framework for coding agents. It’s MIT-licensed, and can work with any LLM—including big proprietary LLMs like Claude and OpenAI, as well as open source LLMs like Qwen and Devstral.

Other SDKs (e.g. [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python)) are proprietary and lock you into a particular model. Given how quickly models are evolving, it’s best to stay model-agnostic!
