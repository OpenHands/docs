The [OpenHands SDK](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/agent-sdk) allows you to build things with agents that write software. For instance, some use cases include:

1. A documentation system that checks the changes made to your codebase this week and updates them
2. An SRE system that reads your server logs and your codebase, then uses this info to debug new errors that are appearing in prod
3. A customer onboarding system that takes all of their documents in unstructured format and enters information into your database

This SDK also powers [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands), an all-batteries-included coding agent that you can access through a GUI, CLI, or API.
