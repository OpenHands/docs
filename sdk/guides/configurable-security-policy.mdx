# Configurable Security Policy

OpenHands agents use security policies to assess the risk level of their actions. By default, agents use a built-in security policy template, but you can customize this to match your organization's specific security requirements.

## Overview

Security policies define risk assessment guidelines that help agents evaluate the safety of their actions. They typically categorize actions into different risk levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) and provide specific rules for when to escalate risk assessments.

## Default Security Policy

By default, all agents use the built-in `security_policy.j2` template. This provides standard risk assessment guidelines for common operations.

## Custom Security Policy

You can provide your own security policy template by specifying the `security_policy_filename` parameter when creating an agent. This allows you to:

- Define custom risk categories
- Add organization-specific security rules
- Customize risk escalation criteria
- Include domain-specific security considerations

## Example

```python icon="python" expandable examples/01_standalone_sdk/28_configurable_security_policy.py
<code will be auto-synced>
```

## Key Features

### 1. Default Policy Usage
The example shows how agents automatically use the built-in security policy when no custom policy is specified.

### 2. Custom Policy Creation
Demonstrates creating a custom security policy template with:
- Custom risk level definitions
- Organization-specific rules
- Tailored security guidelines

### 3. Policy Application
Shows how to apply the custom policy using the `security_policy_filename` parameter.

### 4. Policy Verification
Includes verification that the custom policy is properly embedded in the agent's system message.

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the default policy** and customize only what you need
2. **Test your custom policies** thoroughly before deploying
3. **Keep policies concise** but comprehensive
4. **Document your custom rules** clearly
5. **Review and update policies** regularly

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise environments** with specific compliance requirements
- **High-security applications** requiring stricter risk assessment
- **Domain-specific deployments** with unique security considerations
- **Multi-tenant systems** with varying security levels

Custom security policies help ensure that your OpenHands agents operate within your organization's security boundaries while maintaining their effectiveness.
