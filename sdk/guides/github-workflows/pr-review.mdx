description: Use OpenHands Agent to generate meaningful pull request review
---

> The reference workflow is available [here](#reference-workflow)!

Automatically review pull requests, providing feedback on code quality, security, and best practices. Reviews can be triggered in two ways:
- Requesting `openhands-agent` as a reviewer
- Adding the `review-this` label to the PR

<Note>
The reference workflow triggers on either the "review-this" label or when the openhands-agent account is requested as a reviewer. In OpenHands organization repositories, openhands-agent has access, so this works as-is. In your own repositories, requesting openhands-agent will only work if that account is added as a collaborator or is part of a team with access. If you don't plan to grant access, use the label trigger instead, or change the condition to a reviewer handle that exists in your repo.
</Note>

## Review Modes

The PR review workflow supports two modes:

| Mode | Description | Required Secrets |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **SDK Mode** (default) | Runs the agent locally in GitHub Actions | `LLM_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| **Cloud Mode** | Runs asynchronously in OpenHands Cloud | `OPENHANDS_CLOUD_API_KEY` only |

### Cloud Mode Benefits

- **Minimal configuration** - Only one secret needed
- **No LLM setup** - Uses your OpenHands Cloud account's configured LLM
- **No GITHUB_TOKEN needed** - Agent uses your cloud-configured GitHub credentials
- **Faster CI completion** - Workflow exits immediately; review runs in background
- **Track progress** - View the conversation in the OpenHands Cloud UI

## Quick Start

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="SDK Mode (Default)">
    ```bash
    # 1. Copy workflow to your repository
    cp examples/03_github_workflows/02_pr_review/workflow.yml .github/workflows/pr-review.yml

    # 2. Configure secrets in GitHub Settings → Secrets
    # Add: LLM_API_KEY

    # 3. (Optional) Create a "review-this" label in your repository
    # Go to Issues → Labels → New label
    # You can also trigger reviews by requesting "openhands-agent" as a reviewer
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cloud Mode">
    ```bash
    # 1. Copy workflow to your repository
    cp examples/03_github_workflows/02_pr_review/workflow.yml .github/workflows/pr-review.yml

    # 2. Configure secrets in GitHub Settings → Secrets
    # Add: OPENHANDS_CLOUD_API_KEY (get from https://app.all-hands.dev/settings/api-keys)

    # 3. Update the workflow to use cloud mode:
    # Set mode: cloud and remove llm-api-key and github-token

    # 4. (Optional) Create a "review-this" label in your repository
    ```

## Features

- **Fast Reviews** - Results posted on the PR in only 2 or 3 minutes
- **Comprehensive Analysis** - Analyzes the changes given the repository context. Covers code quality, security, best practices
- **GitHub Integration** - Posts comments directly to the PR
- **Customizable** - Add your own code review guidelines without forking
- **Two Modes** - Run locally (SDK) or in the cloud (asynchronous)

## Security

- Users with write access (maintainers) can trigger reviews by requesting `openhands-agent` as a reviewer or adding the `review-this` label.
- Maintainers need to read the PR to make sure it's safe to run.

## Customizing the Code Review

Instead of forking the `agent_script.py`, you can customize the code review behavior by adding a `.agents/skills/code-review.md` file to your repository. This is the **recommended approach** for customization.

### How It Works

The PR review agent uses skills from the [OpenHands/skills](https://github.com/OpenHands/skills) repository by default. When you add a `.openhands/skills/code-review.md` file to your repository, it **overrides** the default skill with your custom guidelines.

### Example: Custom Code Review Skill

Create `.openhands/skills/code-review.md` in your repository:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Custom code review guidelines for my project
triggers:
- /codereview
---

# My Project Code Review Guidelines

You are a code reviewer for this project. Follow these guidelines:

## Review Decisions

- **APPROVE** straightforward changes (config updates, typo fixes, documentation)
- **COMMENT** when you have feedback or concerns

## What to Check

- Code follows our project conventions
- Tests are included for new functionality
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Documentation is updated if needed

## Communication Style

- Be direct and constructive
- Use GitHub suggestion syntax for code fixes
- Approve quickly when code is good
```

### Benefits of Custom Skills

1. **No forking required**: Keep using the official SDK while customizing behavior
2. **Version controlled**: Your review guidelines live in your repository
3. **Easy updates**: SDK updates don't overwrite your customizations
4. **Team alignment**: Everyone uses the same review standards

<Note>
See the [software-agent-sdk's own code-review skill](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/.openhands/skills/code-review.md) for a complete example of a custom code review skill.

# OpenHands PR Review Workflow
#
# To set this up:
#  1. Copy this file to .github/workflows/pr-review.yml in your repository
#  2. Add LLM_API_KEY to repository secrets
#  3. Customize the inputs below as needed
#  4. Commit this file to your repository
#  5. Trigger the review by either:
#     - Adding the "review-this" label to any PR, OR
#     - Requesting openhands-agent as a reviewer
#

### Cloud Mode Workflow Example

For cloud mode, the workflow is simpler since you only need the cloud API key:

```yaml icon="yaml"
name: PR Review by OpenHands (Cloud Mode)

on:
    pull_request:
        types: [labeled, review_requested]

permissions:
    contents: read
    pull-requests: write
    issues: write

jobs:
    pr-review:
        if: |
            github.event.label.name == 'review-this' ||
            github.event.requested_reviewer.login == 'openhands-agent'
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Checkout for composite action
              uses: actions/checkout@v4
              with:
                  repository: OpenHands/software-agent-sdk
                  ref: main
                  sparse-checkout: .github/actions/pr-review

            - name: Run PR Review
              uses: ./.github/actions/pr-review
              with:
                  mode: cloud
                  review-style: roasted
                  # Only the cloud API key is needed
                  openhands-cloud-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENHANDS_CLOUD_API_KEY }}
```

<Note>
In cloud mode, the workflow exits immediately after starting the review. The agent runs asynchronously in OpenHands Cloud and posts review comments when done. You can track progress via the conversation URL printed in the workflow logs.
