title: Hooks
description: Use lifecycle hooks to observe, log, and customize agent execution.
---

## Overview

Hooks let you observe and customize key lifecycle moments in the SDK without forking core code. Typical uses include:
- Logging and analytics
- Emitting custom metrics
- Auditing or compliance
- Tracing and debugging

<Note>
This example is available on GitHub: [examples/01_standalone_sdk/33_hooks.py](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/examples/01_standalone_sdk/33_hooks.py)
</Note>

```python icon="python" expandable examples/01_standalone_sdk/33_hooks.py
# The code in this block will be automatically synced from the agent-sdk repository.
# If you see this message, run the sync script or view the GitHub source linked above.
```

```bash Running the Example
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"
cd agent-sdk
uv run python examples/01_standalone_sdk/33_hooks.py
```

## Key Concepts

- Registration points: subscribe to events or attach pre/post hooks around LLM calls and tool execution
- Isolation: hooks run outside the agent loop logic, avoiding core modifications
- Composition: enable or disable hooks per environment (local vs. prod)
