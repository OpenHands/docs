title: Agent Skills & Context
description: Skills (formerly called Microagents) add specialized behaviors, domain knowledge, and context-aware triggers to your agent through structured prompts.
---

## What are Skills?

Skills (previously known as Microagents) are specialized prompts that enhance your agent with domain-specific knowledge, guidelines, and behaviors. They provide a powerful way to:

- **Add Expert Guidance**: Inject domain-specific knowledge (e.g., coding standards, API usage patterns)
- **Automate Common Tasks**: Define consistent practices across projects
- **Context-Aware Behavior**: Activate specific instructions based on keywords or always-on rules
- **Repository Memory**: Store persistent knowledge about your codebase

<Note>
Skills take up space in the context window alongside user messages. They inform the agent about the task and environment, so use them judiciously.
</Note>

## Types of Skills

The SDK supports two main types of skills:

### 1. General Skills (Always Active)

General skills are always loaded and provide constant guidance to your agent. They're ideal for:
- Repository-specific guidelines and structure
- Coding standards and best practices
- Development workflows and CI/CD information

**Example: Repository Context**

```markdown
# Repository Purpose
This project is a TODO application that allows users to track TODO items.

# Setup Instructions
To set it up, you can run `npm run build`.

# Repository Structure
- `/src`: Core application code
- `/tests`: Test suite
- `/docs`: Documentation
- `/.github`: CI/CD workflows

# Development Guidelines
Always make sure the tests are passing before committing changes. 
You can run the tests by running `npm run test`.
```

### 2. Keyword-Triggered Skills

Keyword-triggered skills are only loaded when specific keywords appear in user messages. They're perfect for:
- Framework-specific instructions (e.g., "react", "django")
- Tool-specific guidance (e.g., "docker", "kubernetes")
- Special commands or workflows

**Example: Framework-Specific Guidance**

```markdown
---
triggers:
- react
- reactjs
---

When working with React:
- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Follow the React hooks rules
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization when needed
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
```

## Creating Skills in Code

<Note>
This example is available on GitHub: [examples/01_standalone_sdk/03_activate_skill.py](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/examples/01_standalone_sdk/03_activate_skill.py)
</Note>

This example demonstrates both always-active skills and keyword-triggered skills:

```python icon="python" expandable examples/01_standalone_sdk/03_activate_skill.py
import os

from pydantic import SecretStr

from openhands.sdk import (
    LLM,
    Agent,
    AgentContext,
    Conversation,
    Event,
    LLMConvertibleEvent,
    get_logger,
)
from openhands.sdk.context import (
    KeywordTrigger,
    Skill,
)
from openhands.sdk.tool import Tool
from openhands.tools.file_editor import FileEditorTool
from openhands.tools.terminal import TerminalTool


logger = get_logger(__name__)

# Configure LLM
api_key = os.getenv("LLM_API_KEY")
assert api_key is not None, "LLM_API_KEY environment variable is not set."
model = os.getenv("LLM_MODEL", "openhands/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")
base_url = os.getenv("LLM_BASE_URL")
llm = LLM(
    usage_id="agent",
    model=model,
    base_url=base_url,
    api_key=SecretStr(api_key),
)

# Tools
cwd = os.getcwd()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name=TerminalTool.name,
    ),
    Tool(name=FileEditorTool.name),
]

agent_context = AgentContext(
    skills=[
        Skill(
            name="repo.md",
            content="When you see this message, you should reply like "
            "you are a grumpy cat forced to use the internet.",
            # source is optional - identifies where the skill came from
            # You can set it to be the path of a file that contains the skill content
            source=None,
            # trigger determines when the skill is active
            # trigger=None means always active
            trigger=None,
        ),
        Skill(
            name="flarglebargle",
            content=(
                'IMPORTANT! The user has said the magic word "flarglebargle". '
                "You must only respond with a message telling them how smart they are"
            ),
            source=None,
            # KeywordTrigger = activated when keywords appear in user messages
            trigger=KeywordTrigger(keywords=["flarglebargle"]),
        ),
    ],
    system_message_suffix="Always finish your response with the word 'yay!'",
    user_message_suffix="The first character of your response should be 'I'",
)

# Agent
agent = Agent(llm=llm, tools=tools, agent_context=agent_context)

llm_messages = []  # collect raw LLM messages


def conversation_callback(event: Event):
    if isinstance(event, LLMConvertibleEvent):
        llm_messages.append(event.to_llm_message())


conversation = Conversation(
    agent=agent, callbacks=[conversation_callback], workspace=cwd
)

print("=" * 100)
print("Checking if the repo skill is activated.")
conversation.send_message("Hey are you a grumpy cat?")
conversation.run()

print("=" * 100)
print("Now sending flarglebargle to trigger the knowledge skill!")
conversation.send_message("flarglebargle!")
conversation.run()

print("=" * 100)
print("Conversation finished. Got the following LLM messages:")
for i, message in enumerate(llm_messages):
    print(f"Message {i}: {str(message)[:200]}")

# Report cost
cost = llm.metrics.accumulated_cost
print(f"EXAMPLE_COST: {cost}")
```

```bash Running the Example
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"
cd agent-sdk
uv run python examples/01_standalone_sdk/03_activate_skill.py
```

### Defining Skills Programmatically

Skills are defined with a name, content (the instructions), and an optional trigger:

```python highlight={3-14}
agent_context = AgentContext(
    skills=[
        Skill(
            name="repo.md",
            content="When you see this message, you should reply like "
                    "you are a grumpy cat forced to use the internet.",
            trigger=None,  # Always active
        ),
        Skill(
            name="flarglebargle",
            content='IMPORTANT! The user has said the magic word "flarglebargle". '
                    "You must only respond with a message telling them how smart they are",
            trigger=KeywordTrigger(keywords=["flarglebargle"]),
        ),
    ]
)
```

**Key Parameters:**
- `name`: Identifier for the skill
- `content`: The instructions/guidelines (can be multi-line)
- `source`: Optional path to file containing skill content
- `trigger`: `None` for always-active, or `KeywordTrigger` for keyword-based activation

### Keyword Triggers

Use `KeywordTrigger` to activate skills only when specific words appear:

```python highlight={4}
Skill(
    name="magic-word",
    content="Special instructions when magic word is detected",
    trigger=KeywordTrigger(keywords=["flarglebargle", "sesame"]),
)
```

### Message Suffixes for `AgentContext`

Add consistent prefixes or suffixes to system and user messages:

```python highlight={3-4}
agent_context = AgentContext(
    skills=[...],
    system_message_suffix="Always finish your response with the word 'yay!'",
    user_message_suffix="The first character of your response should be 'I'",
)
```

## Loading Skills from Files

While the SDK examples show creating skills programmatically, a common pattern is to load skills from `.openhands/microagents/` directory in your repository:

```
your-repository/
└── .openhands/
    └── microagents/
        ├── repo.md              # General guidelines (always active)
        ├── react.md             # Framework-specific (keyword-triggered)
        └── docker.md            # Tool-specific (keyword-triggered)
```

### Loading Example

```python
from pathlib import Path
from openhands.sdk.context import Skill, KeywordTrigger

def load_skill_from_file(filepath: Path) -> Skill:
    """Load a skill from a markdown file."""
    content = filepath.read_text()
    
    # Parse frontmatter if present to extract triggers
    # (implementation depends on your frontmatter parser)
    
    return Skill(
        name=filepath.stem,
        content=content,
        source=str(filepath),
        trigger=None,  # or KeywordTrigger based on frontmatter
    )

# Load all skills from .openhands/microagents/
microagents_dir = Path(".openhands/microagents")
skills = [
    load_skill_from_file(f) 
    for f in microagents_dir.glob("*.md")
    if f.is_file()
]

agent_context = AgentContext(skills=skills)
```

### Best Practices

- **Keep Skills Focused**: Each skill should address a specific domain or task
- **Use Clear Instructions**: Provide explicit, unambiguous guidelines
- **Include Examples**: Add practical examples of common use cases
- **Consider Context Window**: Skills consume tokens, so be concise
- **Test Triggers**: Verify keyword triggers activate correctly
- **Avoid Conflicts**: Ensure skills don't contradict each other

### Creating a Comprehensive Repository Skill

For a general repository skill, you can prompt an agent to analyze your codebase:

```
Please browse the repository, look at the documentation and relevant code, 
and understand the purpose of this repository.

Create a `.openhands/microagents/repo.md` file with:
1. The purpose of this repository
2. The general setup of this repo
3. A brief description of the structure
4. CI/CD workflows and checks (from .github/ directory)
```

This creates persistent memory that helps the agent work more effectively with your codebase.
