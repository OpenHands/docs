title: Agent Skills & Context
description: Skills add specialized behaviors, domain knowledge, and context-aware triggers to your agent through structured prompts.
---

Skills modify agent behavior by injecting additional context and rules. OpenHands supports an **extended version** of the [AgentSkills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) with additional trigger-based activation.

## Overview

| Feature | Standard AgentSkills | OpenHands Extension |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| SKILL.md format | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| `name`, `description` | ✅ Required | ✅ Required |
| `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata` | ✅ Optional | ✅ Optional |
| `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
| `triggers` field | ❌ Not in standard | ✅ OpenHands extension |
| Activation | Agent decides based on description | Automatic keyword matching OR agent decides |

<Note>
The official AgentSkills standard lists all skills in the system prompt with their description and location, letting the agent decide when to read the full content. OpenHands extends this with optional `triggers` for automatic keyword-based activation.
</Note>

## Inline Skills

<Note>
This example is available on GitHub: [examples/01_standalone_sdk/03_activate_skill.py](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/examples/01_standalone_sdk/03_activate_skill.py)
</Note>

Define skills directly in your code with always-active or keyword-triggered behavior:

```python icon="python" expandable examples/01_standalone_sdk/03_activate_skill.py
import os

from pydantic import SecretStr

from openhands.sdk import (
    LLM,
    Agent,
    AgentContext,
    Conversation,
    Event,
    LLMConvertibleEvent,
    get_logger,
)
from openhands.sdk.context import (
    KeywordTrigger,
    Skill,
)
from openhands.sdk.tool import Tool
from openhands.tools.file_editor import FileEditorTool
from openhands.tools.terminal import TerminalTool


logger = get_logger(__name__)

# Configure LLM
api_key = os.getenv("LLM_API_KEY")
assert api_key is not None, "LLM_API_KEY environment variable is not set."
model = os.getenv("LLM_MODEL", "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")
base_url = os.getenv("LLM_BASE_URL")
llm = LLM(
    usage_id="agent",
    model=model,
    base_url=base_url,
    api_key=SecretStr(api_key),
)

# Tools
cwd = os.getcwd()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name=TerminalTool.name,
    ),
    Tool(name=FileEditorTool.name),
]

# AgentContext provides flexible ways to customize prompts:
# 1. Skills: Inject instructions (always-active or keyword-triggered)
# 2. system_message_suffix: Append text to the system prompt
# 3. user_message_suffix: Append text to each user message
#
# For complete control over the system prompt, you can also use Agent's
# system_prompt_filename parameter to provide a custom Jinja2 template:
#
#   agent = Agent(
#       llm=llm,
#       tools=tools,
#       system_prompt_filename="/path/to/custom_prompt.j2",
#       system_prompt_kwargs={"cli_mode": True, "repo": "my-project"},
#   )
#
# See: https://docs.openhands.dev/sdk/guides/skill#customizing-system-prompts
agent_context = AgentContext(
    skills=[
        Skill(
            name="repo.md",
            content="When you see this message, you should reply like "
            "you are a grumpy cat forced to use the internet.",
            # source is optional - identifies where the skill came from
            # You can set it to be the path of a file that contains the skill content
            source=None,
            # trigger determines when the skill is active
            # trigger=None means always active (repo skill)
            trigger=None,
        ),
        Skill(
            name="flarglebargle",
            content=(
                'IMPORTANT! The user has said the magic word "flarglebargle". '
                "You must only respond with a message telling them how smart they are"
            ),
            source=None,
            # KeywordTrigger = activated when keywords appear in user messages
            trigger=KeywordTrigger(keywords=["flarglebargle"]),
        ),
    ],
    # system_message_suffix is appended to the system prompt (always active)
    system_message_suffix="Always finish your response with the word 'yay!'",
    # user_message_suffix is appended to each user message
    user_message_suffix="The first character of your response should be 'I'",
    # You can also enable automatic load skills from
    # public registry at https://github.com/OpenHands/skills
    load_public_skills=True,
)

# Agent
agent = Agent(llm=llm, tools=tools, agent_context=agent_context)

llm_messages = []  # collect raw LLM messages


def conversation_callback(event: Event):
    if isinstance(event, LLMConvertibleEvent):
        llm_messages.append(event.to_llm_message())


conversation = Conversation(
    agent=agent, callbacks=[conversation_callback], workspace=cwd
)

print("=" * 100)
print("Checking if the repo skill is activated.")
conversation.send_message("Hey are you a grumpy cat?")
conversation.run()

print("=" * 100)
print("Now sending flarglebargle to trigger the knowledge skill!")
conversation.send_message("flarglebargle!")
conversation.run()

print("=" * 100)
print("Now triggering public skill 'github'")
conversation.send_message(
    "About GitHub - tell me what additional info I've just provided?"
)
conversation.run()

print("=" * 100)
print("Conversation finished. Got the following LLM messages:")
for i, message in enumerate(llm_messages):
    print(f"Message {i}: {str(message)[:200]}")

# Report cost
cost = llm.metrics.accumulated_cost
print(f"EXAMPLE_COST: {cost}")
```

```bash Running the Example
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"
cd agent-sdk
uv run python examples/01_standalone_sdk/03_activate_skill.py
```

### Creating Skills

Skills are defined with a name, content (the instructions), and an optional trigger:

```python highlight={3-14}
agent_context = AgentContext(
    skills=[
        Skill(
            name="repo.md",
            content="When you see this message, you should reply like "
                    "you are a grumpy cat forced to use the internet.",
            trigger=None,  # Always active
        ),
        Skill(
            name="flarglebargle",
            content='IMPORTANT! The user has said the magic word "flarglebargle". '
                    "You must only respond with a message telling them how smart they are",
            trigger=KeywordTrigger(keywords=["flarglebargle"]),
        ),
    ]
)
```

### Keyword Triggers

Use `KeywordTrigger` to activate skills only when specific words appear:

```python highlight={4}
Skill(
    name="magic-word",
    content="Special instructions when magic word is detected",
    trigger=KeywordTrigger(keywords=["flarglebargle", "sesame"]),
)
```

### How Skills Appear in the System Prompt

Skills are handled differently based on their trigger type:

| Trigger Type | System Prompt | When Content is Loaded |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|
| `trigger=None` | Full content in `<REPO_CONTEXT>` | Always (at startup) |
| `KeywordTrigger` | Listed in `<SKILLS>` with location | When keyword detected in user message |
| `TaskTrigger` | Listed in `<SKILLS>` with location | When task type matches |

For triggered skills, the system prompt includes an `<available_skills>` block (following the AgentSkills standard format):

```xml
<SKILLS>
The following skills are available and may be triggered by keywords or task types.
You can also directly look up a skill's full content by reading its location path.

<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>magic-word</name>
    <description>Special instructions when magic word is detected</description>
    <location>/path/to/skill</location>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
</SKILLS>
```

When a keyword is detected, the skill's full content is injected into the conversation as `<EXTRA_INFO>`.

## Loading Skills from Disk (AgentSkills Standard)

<Note>
This example is available on GitHub: [examples/05_skills_and_plugins/01_loading_agentskills/main.py](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/examples/05_skills_and_plugins/01_loading_agentskills/main.py)
</Note>

OpenHands supports the [AgentSkills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) for organizing skills as self-contained packages with scripts, references, and assets.

### Directory Structure

Each skill is a directory containing:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: Skill definition with frontmatter
├── scripts/          # Optional: Executable scripts
│   └── helper.sh
├── references/       # Optional: Reference documentation
│   └── examples.md
└── assets/           # Optional: Static assets
    └── config.json
```

### SKILL.md Format

The `SKILL.md` file defines the skill with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill                    # Required (standard)
description: >                    # Required (standard)
  A brief description of what this skill does and when to use it.
license: MIT                      # Optional (standard)
compatibility: Requires bash      # Optional (standard)
metadata:                         # Optional (standard)
  author: your-name
  version: "1.0"
triggers:                         # Optional (OpenHands extension)
  - keyword1
  - keyword2
---

# Skill Content

Instructions and documentation for the agent...
```

#### Standard vs Extension Fields

| Field | Source | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `name` | Standard | Skill identifier (max 64 chars, lowercase + hyphens) |
| `description` | Standard | What the skill does and when to use it (max 1024 chars) |
| `license` | Standard | License name or reference |
| `compatibility` | Standard | Environment requirements |
| `metadata` | Standard | Arbitrary key-value pairs |
| `triggers` | **OpenHands** | Keywords that auto-activate this skill |

<Warning>
The `triggers` field is an OpenHands extension not part of the official AgentSkills standard. Skills using this field may not be portable to other AgentSkills-compatible tools.
</Warning>

#### Trigger Behavior

| Has `triggers`? | System Prompt | Content Loading |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Yes | Listed in `<SKILLS>` | Injected when keyword detected |
| No | Full content in `<REPO_CONTEXT>` | Always loaded at startup |

<Note>
**Known limitation**: The official AgentSkills standard recommends progressive disclosure where ALL skills are listed with just name/description/location, and the agent decides when to read full content. Currently, OpenHands loads full content for skills without triggers. See [issue #1646](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/issues/1646) for discussion.
</Note>

### Loading Skills

Use `load_skills_from_dir()` to load all skills from a directory:

```python icon="python" expandable examples/05_skills_and_plugins/01_loading_agentskills/main.py
"""Example: Loading Skills from Disk (AgentSkills Standard)

This example demonstrates how to load skills following the AgentSkills standard
from a directory on disk.

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend an agent's capabilities
by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. They follow the
AgentSkills standard which includes:
- SKILL.md file with frontmatter metadata (name, description, triggers)
- Optional resource directories: scripts/, references/, assets/

See the example_skills/ directory for a complete skill structure.

### Key Functions

#### `load_skills_from_dir()`

Loads all skills from a directory, returning three dictionaries:

```python
from openhands.sdk.context.skills import load_skills_from_dir

repo_skills, knowledge_skills, agent_skills = load_skills_from_dir(skills_dir)
```

- **repo_skills**: Skills from `repo.md` files (always active)
- **knowledge_skills**: Skills from `knowledge/` subdirectories
- **agent_skills**: Skills from `SKILL.md` files (AgentSkills standard)

#### `discover_skill_resources()`

Discovers resource files in a skill directory:

```python
from openhands.sdk.context.skills import discover_skill_resources

resources = discover_skill_resources(skill_dir)
print(resources.scripts)     # List of script files
print(resources.references)  # List of reference files
print(resources.assets)      # List of asset files
print(resources.skill_root)  # Path to skill directory
```

### Skill Location in Prompts

The `<location>` element in `<available_skills>` follows the AgentSkills standard, allowing agents to read the full skill content on demand. When a triggered skill is activated, the content is injected with the location path:

```
<EXTRA_INFO>
The following information has been included based on a keyword match for "encrypt".

Skill location: /path/to/rot13-encryption
(Use this path to resolve relative file references in the skill content below)

[skill content from SKILL.md]
</EXTRA_INFO>
```

This enables skills to reference their own scripts and resources using relative paths like `./scripts/encrypt.sh`.

### Example Skill: ROT13 Encryption

Here's a skill with triggers (OpenHands extension):

**SKILL.md:**
```yaml
---
name: rot13-encryption
description: >
  This skill helps encrypt and decrypt messages using ROT13 cipher.
triggers:
  - encrypt
  - decrypt
  - cipher
---

# ROT13 Encryption Skill

Run the [encrypt.sh](scripts/encrypt.sh) script with your message:

\`\`\`bash
./scripts/encrypt.sh "your message"
\`\`\`
```

**scripts/encrypt.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "$1" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```

When the user says "encrypt", the skill is triggered and the agent can use the provided script.

## Loading Public Skills

OpenHands maintains a [public skills repository](https://github.com/OpenHands/skills) with community-contributed skills. You can automatically load these skills without waiting for SDK updates.

### Automatic Loading via AgentContext

Enable public skills loading in your `AgentContext`:

```python highlight={2}
agent_context = AgentContext(
    load_public_skills=True,  # Auto-load from public registry
    skills=[
        # Your custom skills here
    ]
)
```

When enabled, the SDK will:
1. Clone or update the public skills repository to `~/.openhands/cache/skills/` on first run
2. Load all available skills from the repository
3. Merge them with your explicitly defined skills

**Skill Precedence**: If a skill name conflicts, your explicitly defined skills take precedence over public skills.

### Programmatic Loading

You can also load public skills manually and have more control:

```python
from openhands.sdk.context.skills import load_public_skills

# Load all public skills
public_skills = load_public_skills()

# Use with AgentContext
agent_context = AgentContext(skills=public_skills)

# Or combine with custom skills
my_skills = [
    Skill(name="custom", content="Custom instructions", trigger=None)
]
agent_context = AgentContext(skills=my_skills + public_skills)
```

### Custom Skills Repository

You can load skills from your own repository:

```python
from openhands.sdk.context.skills import load_public_skills

# Load from a custom repository
custom_skills = load_public_skills(
    repo_url="https://github.com/my-org/my-skills",
    branch="main"
)
```

### How It Works

The `load_public_skills()` function uses git-based caching for efficiency:

- **First run**: Clones the skills repository to `~/.openhands/cache/skills/public-skills/`
- **Subsequent runs**: Pulls the latest changes to keep skills up-to-date
- **Offline mode**: Uses the cached version if network is unavailable

This approach is more efficient than fetching individual skill files via HTTP and ensures you always have access to the latest community skills.

<Note>
Explore available public skills at [github.com/OpenHands/skills](https://github.com/OpenHands/skills). These skills cover various domains like GitHub integration, Python development, debugging, and more.
</Note>

## Customizing Agent Context

### Message Suffixes

Append custom instructions to the system prompt or user messages via `AgentContext`:

```python
agent_context = AgentContext(
    system_message_suffix="""
<REPOSITORY_INFO>
Repository: my-project
Branch: feature/new-api
</REPOSITORY_INFO>
    """.strip(),
    user_message_suffix="Remember to explain your reasoning."
)
```

- **`system_message_suffix`**: Appended to system prompt (always active, combined with repo skills)
- **`user_message_suffix`**: Appended to each user message

### Replacing the Entire System Prompt

For complete control, provide a custom Jinja2 template via the `Agent` class:

```python
from openhands.sdk import Agent

agent = Agent(
    llm=llm,
    tools=tools,
    system_prompt_filename="/path/to/custom_system_prompt.j2",  # Absolute path
    system_prompt_kwargs={"cli_mode": True, "repo_name": "my-project"}
)
```

**Custom template example** (`custom_system_prompt.j2`):

```jinja2
You are a helpful coding assistant for {{ repo_name }}.

{% if cli_mode %}
You are running in CLI mode. Keep responses concise.
{% endif %}

Follow these guidelines:
- Write clean, well-documented code
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Suggest tests when appropriate
```

**Key points:**
- Use relative filenames (e.g., `"system_prompt.j2"`) to load from the agent's prompts directory
- Use absolute paths (e.g., `"/path/to/prompt.j2"`) to load from any location
- Pass variables to the template via `system_prompt_kwargs`
- The `system_message_suffix` from `AgentContext` is automatically appended after your custom prompt

## Next Steps

- **[Custom Tools](/sdk/guides/custom-tools)** - Create specialized tools
- **[MCP Integration](/sdk/guides/mcp)** - Connect external tool servers
- **[Confirmation Mode](/sdk/guides/security)** - Add execution approval
