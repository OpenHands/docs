title: ApplyPatch with GPT-5.1
description: Use the GPT-5.1 apply_patch tool format to perform rich multi-file edits via the ApplyPatch tool.
---


This guide shows how to use the `ApplyPatch` tool with GPT-5.1 models using the `apply_patch` text format introduced in the OpenAI cookbook. The tool lets the model propose unified patches that can:

- Create new files
- Apply multi-hunk edits to a single file
- Touch multiple files in a single patch
- Mix add / update / delete operations safely

The SDK wires this up as a normal tool, so you can run it inside an `Agent` and `Conversation` like any other tool.

## Example

```python icon="python" expandable
"""Example: Using ApplyPatch tool with GPT-5.1 models via direct OpenAI API.

This demonstrates adding the ApplyPatch tool to the agent and guiding the
model through a richer sequence of file operations using 'apply_patch' text:

- Create multiple files (FACTS.txt, NOTES.md)
- Apply multi-hunk edits to a single file
- Apply a single patch that touches multiple files
- Mix add / update / delete operations in one patch

Notes:
- Works with any GPT-5.1 family model (names start with "gpt-5.1").
- Uses direct OpenAI API through LiteLLM's LLM wrapper with no base_url.
- Requires OPENAI_API_KEY in the environment (or LLM_API_KEY fallback).

    "You have access to an apply_patch tool that edits files using unified patches. "
    "Use it to perform the following sequence of operations in as few patches as "
    "reasonable, while keeping each patch valid and focused:\n\n"
    "1) Create two files:\n"
    "   - FACTS.txt containing exactly two lines:\n"
    "       OpenHands SDK integrates tools.\n"
    "       ApplyPatch can edit multiple files.\n"
    "   - NOTES.md containing exactly three lines:\n"
    "       # Notes\n"
    "       - Initial point A\n"
    "       - Initial point B\n\n"
    "2) Apply a multi-hunk update to NOTES.md in a single *** Update File block:\n"
    "   - Change the text 'Initial point A' to 'Updated point A'.\n"
    "   - Append a new bullet '- Added via multi-hunk patch.' after "
    "'Initial point B'.\n\n"
    "3) Apply a single patch that updates BOTH FACTS.txt and NOTES.md at once:\n"
    "   - In FACTS.txt, append a third line: 'Multi-file patches are supported.'.\n"
    "   - In NOTES.md, append a final line: 'Summary: multi-file patch applied.'.\n\n"
    "4) Finally, use one more patch that mixes operations across files:\n"
    "   - Add a TEMP.txt file containing a single line: 'Temporary file'.\n"
    "   - Append a line 'Cleanup step ran.' to FACTS.txt.\n"
    "   - Delete TEMP.txt.\n\n"
    "Important rules:\n"
    "- Only call the tool using the apply_patch text format between "
    "'*** Begin Patch' and '*** End Patch'.\n"
    "- Use '*** Add File', '*** Update File', and '*** Delete File' sections as "
    "described in the GPT-5.1 apply_patch guide.\n"
    "- When updating a file, include enough context lines so the patch can be "
    "applied even if whitespace varies slightly.\n"

## How It Works

The example wires the `ApplyPatch` tool into an `Agent` alongside `terminal` and `task_tracker`, then guides a GPT-5.1 model through a sequence of increasingly complex patch operations:

1. **Create files**: The model uses `*** Add File` blocks to create `FACTS.txt` and `NOTES.md` with precise contents.
2. **Multi-hunk update**: A single `*** Update File` block performs multiple edits in `NOTES.md`, demonstrating multi-hunk patches.
3. **Multi-file patch**: One patch updates both `FACTS.txt` and `NOTES.md` together, showing how a single patch can touch multiple files.
4. **Mixed operations**: The final patch adds `TEMP.txt`, appends to `FACTS.txt`, and then deletes `TEMP.txt`, exercising add/update/delete in one go.

All edits are proposed in the GPT-5.1 `apply_patch` text format and executed by the `ApplyPatch` tool inside the workspace.

## When to Use ApplyPatch with GPT-5.1

Prefer `apply_patch` with GPT-5.1 models when:

- You want the model to propose structured, reviewable patches instead of raw file contents
- You need safer multi-file edits and want to avoid brittle position-based editing
- You’re relying on OpenAI’s recommended apply_patch prompting style for their GPT-5.x codex models

For non-GPT-5 models, the default preset continues to use the `file_editor` tool. GPT-5 models use `apply_patch` by default via the SDK’s model-aware preset mapping.
