title: Sub-Agent Delegation
description: Enable parallel task execution by delegating work to multiple sub-agents that run independently and return consolidated results.
---

## Overview

Agent delegation allows a main agent to spawn multiple sub-agents and delegate tasks to them for parallel processing. Each sub-agent runs independently with its own conversation context and returns results that the main agent can consolidate and process further.

This pattern is useful when:
- Breaking down complex problems into independent subtasks
- Processing multiple related tasks in parallel
- Separating concerns between different specialized sub-agents
- Improving throughput for parallelizable work

## Quick Start

<Note>
This example is available on GitHub: [examples/01_standalone_sdk/25_agent_delegation.py](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/examples/01_standalone_sdk/25_agent_delegation.py)

Agent Delegation Example

This example demonstrates the agent delegation feature where a main agent
delegates tasks to sub-agents for parallel processing.
Each sub-agent runs independently and returns its results to the main agent,
which then merges both analyses into a single consolidated report.

    "Please use the delegation tools to handle these two tasks in parallel. "
    "Make sure the sub-agents use their own knowledge "

## How It Works

The delegation system consists of two main operations:

### 1. Spawning Sub-Agents

Before delegating work, the agent must first spawn sub-agents with meaningful identifiers:

```python
# Agent uses the delegate tool to spawn sub-agents
{
    "command": "spawn",
    "ids": ["lodging", "activities"]
}
```

Each spawned sub-agent:
- Gets a unique identifier that the agent specify (e.g., "lodging", "activities")
- Inherits the same LLM configuration as the parent agent
- Operates in the same workspace as the main agent
- Maintains its own independent conversation context

### 2. Delegating Tasks

Once sub-agents are spawned, the agent can delegate tasks to them:

```python
# Agent uses the delegate tool to assign tasks
{
    "command": "delegate",
    "tasks": {
        "lodging": "Find the best budget-friendly areas to stay in London",
        "activities": "List top 5 must-see attractions and hidden gems in London"
    }
}
```

The delegate operation:
- Runs all sub-agent tasks in parallel using threads
- Blocks until all sub-agents complete their work
- Returns a single consolidated observation with all results
- Handles errors gracefully and reports them per sub-agent

## Setting Up the DelegateTool

### 1. Register the Tool

```python
from openhands.sdk.tool import register_tool
from openhands.tools.delegate import DelegateTool

register_tool("DelegateTool", DelegateTool)
```

### 2. Add to Agent Tools

```python
from openhands.sdk import Tool
from openhands.tools.preset.default import get_default_tools

tools = get_default_tools(enable_browser=False)
tools.append(Tool(name="DelegateTool"))

agent = Agent(llm=llm, tools=tools)
```

### 3. Configure Maximum Sub-Agents (Optional)

The user can limit the maximum number of concurrent sub-agents:

```python
from openhands.tools.delegate import DelegateTool

class CustomDelegateTool(DelegateTool):
    @classmethod
    def create(cls, conv_state, max_children: int = 3):
        # Only allow up to 3 sub-agents
        return super().create(conv_state, max_children=max_children)

register_tool("DelegateTool", CustomDelegateTool)
```

## Tool Commands

### spawn

Initialize sub-agents with meaningful identifiers.

**Parameters:**
- `command`: `"spawn"`
- `ids`: List of string identifiers (e.g., `["research", "implementation", "testing"]`)

**Returns:**
A message indicating the sub-agents were successfully spawned.

**Example:**
```python
{
    "command": "spawn",
    "ids": ["research", "implementation", "testing"]
}
```

### delegate

Send tasks to specific sub-agents and wait for results.

**Parameters:**
- `command`: `"delegate"`
- `tasks`: Dictionary mapping sub-agent IDs to task descriptions

**Returns:**
A consolidated message containing all results from the sub-agents.

**Example:**
```python
{
    "command": "delegate",
    "tasks": {
        "research": "Find best practices for async code",
        "implementation": "Refactor the MyClass class",
        "testing": "Write unit tests for the refactored code"
    }
}
```
