title: Agent Server Package
description: HTTP API server for remote agent execution with conversation/event endpoints and WebSocket streaming.
---

The Agent Server package (`openhands.agent_server`) exposes a FastAPI-based HTTP/WebSocket interface that runs OpenHands conversations remotely. It is stateless with respect to agent logic and does not orchestrate containers by itself. Containerization is handled by workspace implementations (e.g., DockerWorkspace) that launch this server inside a sandbox when needed.

Source: [`openhands-agent-server/`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/tree/main/openhands-agent-server)

## Core Responsibilities

The server provides:

1. **Conversation lifecycle API** - Create, run, pause, delete conversations (source: openhands/agent_server/conversation_router.py)
2. **Event access** - Search, count, get, batch-get conversation events; WebSocket event streaming (source: openhands/agent_server/event_router.py, openhands/agent_server/sockets.py)
3. **Execution utilities** - Start and monitor bash commands; file upload/download; simple Git ops (source: openhands/agent_server/bash_router.py, file_router.py, git_router.py)
4. **Tool registry listing** - Introspect available tools on the server (source: openhands/agent_server/tool_router.py)
5. **Server details** - Health, alive, and server info endpoints (source: openhands/agent_server/server_details_router.py)

```

- App construction and route wiring happen in [`api.py`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/openhands-agent-server/openhands/agent_server/api.py): the app mounts a single `/api` router that includes conversation, event, tool, bash, git, file, vscode, and desktop routers.
- Event and VSCode/Desktop services are initialized in the lifespan context (source: openhands/agent_server/api.py).

## Authentication

- HTTP requests: header `X-Session-API-Key` if session keys are configured (source: openhands/agent_server/dependencies.py, `create_session_api_key_dependency`)
- WebSocket: query parameter `session_api_key` (source: openhands/agent_server/dependencies.py, sockets.py)
- Configuration source: environment-driven `Config` (source: openhands/agent_server/config.py)

## Endpoints (selected)

All REST endpoints are mounted under `/api` unless noted.

- Conversations (source: openhands/agent_server/conversation_router.py)
  - `GET /api/conversations/search` – list
  - `GET /api/conversations/count` – count
  - `GET /api/conversations/{conversation_id}` – get
  - `GET /api/conversations?ids=...` – batch get
  - `POST /api/conversations` – start (accepts `StartConversationRequest` built with SDK `Agent` and `LocalWorkspace`)
  - `POST /api/conversations/{conversation_id}/run` – run loop
  - `POST /api/conversations/{conversation_id}/pause` – pause
  - `DELETE /api/conversations/{conversation_id}` – delete
  - `PATCH /api/conversations/{conversation_id}` – update metadata (title)
  - `POST /api/conversations/{id}/generate_title` – title via LLM
  - `POST /api/conversations/{id}/secrets` – update secrets
  - `POST /api/conversations/{id}/confirmation_policy` – set policy
  - `POST /api/conversations/{id}/security_analyzer` – set analyzer
  - `POST /api/conversations/{id}/ask_agent` – question-only (no state change)

- Events (source: openhands/agent_server/event_router.py)
  - `GET /api/conversations/{conversation_id}/events/search`
  - `GET /api/conversations/{conversation_id}/events/count`
  - `GET /api/conversations/{conversation_id}/events/{event_id}`
  - `GET /api/conversations/{conversation_id}/events?event_ids=...`
  - `POST /api/conversations/{conversation_id}/events` – send `Message`

- Bash (source: openhands/agent_server/bash_router.py)
  - `POST /api/bash/start_bash_command`
  - `POST /api/bash/execute_bash_command`
  - `GET /api/bash/bash_events/search|{event_id}|` (list/get)
  - `DELETE /api/bash/bash_events` – clear

- Files (source: openhands/agent_server/file_router.py)
  - `POST /api/file/upload/{path}` – upload to absolute path
  - `GET /api/file/download/{path}` – download absolute path
  - `GET /api/file/download-trajectory/{conversation_id}` – zip state

- Git (source: openhands/agent_server/git_router.py)
  - `GET /api/git/changes/{path}`
  - `GET /api/git/diff/{path}`

- Tools (source: openhands/agent_server/tool_router.py)
  - `GET /api/tools/` – list registered tools

- Server details (source: openhands/agent_server/server_details_router.py)
  - `GET /alive`, `GET /health`, `GET /server_info`

- WebSockets (source: openhands/agent_server/sockets.py)
  - `WS /sockets/events/{conversation_id}?session_api_key=...&resend_all=bool`
  - `WS /sockets/bash-events?session_api_key=...&resend_all=bool`

## Design Notes

- The server itself does not manage Docker containers. Containerization and lifecycle are handled by workspace implementations such as `DockerWorkspace` in the `openhands-workspace` package, which run this server inside the container and connect via HTTP (source: openhands-workspace/openhands/workspace/docker/workspace.py).
- Request/response models are Pydantic classes in `models.py` (source: openhands/agent_server/models.py).
- Security: schema-level API key checks, path validation for file ops (absolute path enforcement), and typed payloads (sources: dependencies.py, file_router.py).

- SDK’s `RemoteWorkspace` and higher-level `RemoteConversation` use these endpoints (source: openhands/sdk/workspace/remote/*, openhands/sdk/conversation/impl/remote_conversation.py).
