description: Core architectural principles guiding the OpenHands Software Agent SDK's development.
---


The **OpenHands Software Agent SDK** is part of the [OpenHands V1](https://openhands.dev/blog/the-path-to-openhands-v1) effort — a complete architectural rework based on lessons from **OpenHands V0**, one of the most widely adopted open-source coding agents.

[Over the last eighteen months](https://openhands.dev/blog/one-year-of-openhands-a-journey-of-open-source-ai-development), OpenHands V0 evolved from a scrappy prototype into a widely used open-source coding agent. The project grew to tens of thousands of GitHub stars, hundreds of contributors, and multiple production deployments. That growth exposed architectural tensions — tight coupling between research and production, mandatory sandboxing, mutable state, and configuration sprawl — which informed the design principles of agent-sdk in V1.

## Optional Isolation over Mandatory Sandboxing

<Info>
**V0 Challenge:**  
Every tool call in V0 executed in a sandboxed Docker container by default. While this guaranteed reproducibility and security, it also created friction — the agent and sandbox ran as separate processes, states diverged easily, and multi-tenant workloads could crash each other.  
Moreover, with the rise of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which assumes local execution and direct access to user environments, V0's rigid isolation model became incompatible.
</Info>

**V1 Principle:**  
**Sandboxing should be opt-in, not universal.**  
V1 unifies agent and tool execution within a single process by default, aligning with MCP's local-execution model.  
When isolation is needed, the same stack can be transparently containerized, maintaining flexibility without complexity.

## Stateless by Default, One Source of Truth for State

<Info>
**V0 Challenge:**  
V0 relied on mutable Python objects and dynamic typing, which led to silent inconsistencies — failed session restores, version drift, and non-deterministic behavior. Each subsystem tracked its own transient state, making debugging and recovery painful.
</Info>

**V1 Principle:**  
**Keep everything stateless, with exactly one mutable state.**  
All components (agents, tools, LLMs, and configurations) are immutable Pydantic models validated at construction.  
The only mutable entity is the [conversation state](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/openhands-sdk/openhands/sdk/event/conversation_state.py), a single source of truth that enables deterministic replay and robust persistence across sessions or distributed systems.

## Clear Boundaries between Agent and Applications

<Info>
**V0 Challenge:**  
The same codebase powered the CLI, web interface, and integrations (e.g., Github, Gitlab, etc). Over time, application-specific conditionals and prompts polluted the agent core, making it brittle.  
Heavy research dependencies and benchmark integrations further bloated production builds.
</Info>

**V1 Principle:**  
**Maintain strict separation of concerns.**  
V1 divides the system into stable, isolated layers: the [SDK (agent core)](/sdk/arch/overview#1-sdk-%E2%80%93-openhands-sdk), [tools (set of tools)](/sdk/arch/overview#2-tools-%E2%80%93-openhands-tools), [workspace (sandbox)](/sdk/arch/overview#3-workspace-%E2%80%93-openhands-workspace), and [agent server (server that runs inside sandbox)](/sdk/arch/overview#4-agent-server-%E2%80%93-openhands-agent-server).  
Applications communicate with the agent via APIs rather than embedding it directly, ensuring research and production can evolve independently.


## Composable Components for Extensibility

<Info>
**V0 Challenge:**  
Because agent logic was hard-coded into the core application, extending behavior (e.g., adding new tools or entry points) required branching logic for different entrypoints. This rigidity limited experimentation and discouraged contributions.
</Info>

**V1 Principle:**  
**Everything should be composable and safe to extend.**  
Agents are defined as graphs of interchangeable components—tools, prompts, LLMs, and contexts—each described declaratively with strong typing.  
Developers can reconfigure capabilities (e.g., swap toolsets, override prompts, add delegation logic) without modifying core code, preserving stability while fostering rapid innovation.

## Design Invariants (Normative)

This page describes the **architectural invariants** the SDK relies on. These are treated as *contracts* between components.

Where appropriate, we express invariants in a lightweight OCL-like notation:

- `context X inv Name: <predicate>`
- `pre:` / `post:` for pre/post-conditions

If an invariant cannot be expressed precisely in OCL without significant auxiliary modeling, we state it in precise natural language.

### Single Source of Truth for Runtime State

The SDK is designed so that **all runtime state that affects agent execution is representable as an event log plus a small, validated state snapshot**.

- **Configuration objects are immutable** (Pydantic `frozen=True` where applicable).
- **The only intentionally mutable entity is `ConversationState`**, which owns the event log, execution status, secrets registry, and persistence handles.

OCL-like:

- `context AgentBase inv StatelessConfiguration: self.model_config.frozen = true`
- `context Event inv Immutable: self.model_config.frozen = true`

Natural language invariant:

- `ConversationState` is the single coordination point for execution. Other objects may maintain private runtime caches, but **must not** be required to restore or replay a conversation.

### Workspace Boundary is the I/O Boundary

All side effects against the environment (filesystem, processes, git operations) must occur **through a Workspace** (local or remote), which becomes the **I/O boundary**.

- Tools may execute in different runtimes (local process vs inside agent-server), but *conceptually* they always operate against a workspace rooted at `workspace.working_dir`.

OCL-like:

- `context BaseWorkspace inv WorkingDirIsString: self.working_dir.oclIsTypeOf(String)`

### Event Log is the Execution Trace

The event stream is the single authoritative trace of what the agent *saw* and *did*.

Natural language invariant:

- Any agent decision that should be reproducible on replay must be representable as an `LLMConvertibleEvent` (for LLM context) plus associated non-LLM events (e.g., state updates, errors).

### Tool Calls are Explicit, Typed, and Linkable

The SDK assumes an explicit `Action -> Observation` pairing.

OCL-like (conceptual):

- `context ActionEvent inv HasToolCallId: self.tool_call_id <> null`
- `context ObservationEvent inv RefersToAction: self.action_id <> null`

Natural language invariant:

- Observations must be attributable to a specific action/tool call so that conversations can be audited, visualized, and resumed.

### Remote vs Local is an Execution Detail

The SDK makes *deployment mode* (local vs remote) a **runtime selection behind a common interface**, not two separate programming models.

- `Conversation(...)` returns either `LocalConversation` or `RemoteConversation` based on the provided workspace.
- User-facing code typically should not need to change when switching workspaces; you mostly swap configuration.

<Note>
This does **not** mean every optional method behaves identically across workspace types (e.g., `pause()` / `resume()` may be a no-op locally and meaningful remotely). The core conversation API (`send_message`, `run`, events) stays consistent.
</Note>
