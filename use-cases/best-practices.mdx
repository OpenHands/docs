# Use Case Best Practices

Learn how to get the best results from OpenHands for different types of tasks.

## General Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Break Down Large Tasks">
    Complex projects should be divided into smaller, independent tasks that can be completed and verified individually.
    
    **Instead of:** "Rewrite the authentication system"
    
    **Try:** 
    1. "Add password strength validation"
    2. "Implement JWT token refresh"
    3. "Add rate limiting to login endpoint"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Provide Clear Verification">
    Always include how to verify the task is complete:
    
    - Which tests to run
    - What behavior to check
    - What the output should look like
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include Relevant Context">
    Don't assume OpenHands knows project conventions. Explicitly mention:
    
    - File locations and naming conventions
    - Coding patterns to follow
    - Related files to reference
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set Appropriate Boundaries">
    Define what should and shouldn't change:
    
    - Which files are in scope
    - Which APIs must remain stable
    - What dependencies can be added
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## By Use Case Type

### Code Migrations

**Goal:** Transform code from one pattern, language, or framework to another.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Do's">
    - Migrate one file or module at a time
    - Provide before/after examples
    - Include the migration checklist
    - Test after each migration step
    - Preserve existing functionality
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Don'ts">
    - Migrate entire codebase at once
    - Skip verification steps
    - Change behavior during migration
    - Ignore edge cases
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Example instruction:**

```markdown
Migrate src/utils/helpers.js from JavaScript to TypeScript.

Pattern to follow (see src/utils/format.ts for reference):
- Add explicit type annotations
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Export types alongside functions

Checklist:
- [ ] File renamed to .ts
- [ ] All functions have parameter types
- [ ] Return types are explicit
- [ ] No 'any' types used
- [ ] Imports updated in dependent files
- [ ] npx tsc --noEmit passes
```

### Test Coverage

**Goal:** Add tests to existing code to improve reliability.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Do's">
    - Focus on one module at a time
    - Include happy path and error cases
    - Specify the testing framework and patterns
    - Point to existing test examples
    - Cover edge cases
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Don'ts">
    - Write tests for everything at once
    - Skip edge cases
    - Use different patterns than existing tests
    - Forget to mock external dependencies
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Example instruction:**

```markdown
Add unit tests for the OrderService class.

File: tests/services/test_order_service.py
Follow pattern in: tests/services/test_user_service.py

Test cases needed:
1. create_order() - valid order creation
2. create_order() - missing required fields
3. create_order() - invalid product ID
4. get_order() - existing order
5. get_order() - non-existent order
6. cancel_order() - successful cancellation
7. cancel_order() - already shipped order (should fail)

Use fixtures from conftest.py for database mocking.
Target: 90%+ coverage for OrderService
```

### Bug Fixing

**Goal:** Identify and fix issues in the codebase.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Do's">
    - Include reproduction steps
    - Describe expected vs actual behavior
    - Point to relevant log entries or error messages
    - Mention when the bug was introduced if known
    - Request a regression test
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Don'ts">
    - Describe symptoms without context
    - Fix without understanding root cause
    - Skip adding tests
    - Make unrelated changes
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Example instruction:**

```markdown
Fix: Users can't checkout with more than 10 items

Reproduction:
1. Add 11+ items to cart
2. Click "Checkout"
3. Error: "Cart validation failed"

Expected: Checkout succeeds for any valid cart
Actual: Fails for carts with >10 items

Suspected cause: Hardcoded limit in src/services/cart.py line 45

After fix:
- Add test for checkout with 100 items
- Verify existing tests still pass
```

### Documentation

**Goal:** Generate or update project documentation.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Do's">
    - Specify the documentation style
    - Point to existing docs as examples
    - Include all required sections
    - Request examples and code snippets
    - Define the audience
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Don'ts">
    - Generate docs without structure
    - Skip code examples
    - Ignore existing documentation patterns
    - Over-document simple functions
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Example instruction:**

```markdown
Add docstrings to all public functions in src/api/users.py

Style: Google docstrings (see src/api/products.py for examples)

Include:
- Brief description
- Args with types
- Returns with type
- Raises for exceptions
- Example usage for complex functions

Skip: Private methods (prefixed with _)
```

### Refactoring

**Goal:** Improve code structure without changing behavior.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Do's">
    - Define the specific improvement
    - Ensure tests exist before refactoring
    - Make incremental changes
    - Verify behavior is unchanged
    - Keep commits focused
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Don'ts">
    - Change functionality during refactor
    - Refactor without test coverage
    - Make too many changes at once
    - Rename public APIs without migration plan
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Example instruction:**

```markdown
Refactor: Extract email sending logic into a service

Current: Email sending is scattered across multiple controllers
Target: Centralized EmailService class

Steps:
1. Create src/services/email_service.py
2. Move email logic from:
   - src/controllers/user.py (send_welcome_email)
   - src/controllers/order.py (send_confirmation)
   - src/controllers/auth.py (send_reset_link)
3. Update controllers to use EmailService
4. Add interface for testing (mock injection)

Constraints:
- No changes to email content
- No changes to when emails are sent
- All existing tests must pass
```

## Workflow Tips

### Parallel Execution

For large tasks, run multiple OpenHands sessions in parallel:

```
Session 1: Migrate src/components/Button.jsx
Session 2: Migrate src/components/Input.jsx
Session 3: Migrate src/components/Modal.jsx
```

### Iterative Refinement

For complex tasks, iterate:

1. Start with a basic implementation
2. Review and provide feedback
3. Request specific improvements
4. Verify and finalize

### Using Skills

Create [Skills](/overview/skills) to encode:

- Project-specific conventions
- Common patterns
- Frequently used context

This reduces repetition in your instructions.

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to improve over time:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Task completion rate | >90% |
| Tests passing after changes | 100% |
| Code review acceptance | >80% |
| Time saved vs manual | >50% |
