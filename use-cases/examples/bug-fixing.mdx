# Bug Fixing & Debugging

OpenHands can help identify, diagnose, and fix bugs in your codebase.

## Effective Bug Reports

The key to successful bug fixing with OpenHands is providing clear context.

### Essential Information

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe the Bug">
    What's happening vs what should happen
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reproduction Steps">
    Exact steps to trigger the bug
  </Step>
  <Step title="Environment">
    Relevant configuration, versions, data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evidence">
    Error messages, logs, screenshots
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Instruction Template

```markdown
## Bug Description
[What is happening incorrectly]

## Expected Behavior
[What should happen instead]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Observe the bug]

## Error Message/Logs
```
[Paste error messages here]
```

## Relevant Files
- [file path 1]
- [file path 2]

## Additional Context
- When did this start happening?
- Was there a recent change that might have caused this?
- Does it happen consistently or intermittently?

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bug no longer reproduces
- [ ] Regression test added
- [ ] All existing tests pass
```

## Example: API Error Bug

### Bug Report

```markdown
## Bug Description
The /api/users/search endpoint returns 500 error when search 
query contains special characters like "&" or "?".

## Expected Behavior
Should return filtered results or empty array, never 500 error.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Call GET /api/users/search?q=test&value
2. Observe 500 Internal Server Error

## Error Log
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined
    at searchUsers (src/api/users.js:45)
```

## Relevant Files
- src/api/users.js (search endpoint)
- src/services/userSearch.js (search logic)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Special characters in search work correctly
- [ ] Add input sanitization
- [ ] Add test for special character handling
```

### Fix Approach

OpenHands will:
1. Identify the root cause (URL parsing issue)
2. Add proper input validation
3. Fix the search function
4. Add regression tests

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Isolate the Problem">
    Narrow down where the bug occurs before asking for a fix.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Always Add Tests">
    Request a regression test to prevent the bug from returning.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Minimal Changes">
    Fix only the bug; avoid unrelated improvements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify the Fix">
    Include verification steps in your request.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
