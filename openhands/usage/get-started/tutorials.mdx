## Task Complexity Guidance

Before starting, assess your task's complexity:

**Simple tasks** (5-15 minutes):
- Single file changes
- Clear, well-defined requirements
- Existing patterns to follow

**Medium tasks** (15-45 minutes):
- Multiple file changes
- Some discovery required
- Integration with existing code

**Complex tasks** (45+ minutes):
- Architectural changes
- Multiple components
- Requires iteration

<Note>
Start with simpler tutorials to build familiarity with OpenHands before tackling complex tasks.

- Price
- Description
- Image URL
- SKU (if available)

Requirements:
1. Use Python with BeautifulSoup or Scrapy
2. Handle pagination (site has 50 pages)
3. Respect rate limits (1 request/second)
4. Save results to products.json
5. Handle errors gracefully
6. Log progress to console

Include a README with usage instructions.
```

**Tips**:
- Specify rate limiting requirements
- Mention error handling expectations
- Request logging for debugging

### Code Review

#### Tutorial: Security-Focused Code Review

**Goal**: Identify security vulnerabilities in a PR

**Prompt**:
```
Review this pull request for security issues:

Focus areas:
1. Input validation - check all user inputs are sanitized
2. Authentication - verify auth checks are in place
3. SQL injection - check for parameterized queries
4. XSS - verify output encoding
5. Sensitive data - ensure no secrets in code

For each issue found, provide:
- File and line number
- Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Description of the vulnerability
- Suggested fix with code example

Output format: Markdown suitable for PR comments
```
