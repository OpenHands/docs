## Available Commands

The OpenHands CLI provides commands to help with settings and conversations. These commands work by typing `/`
followed by the command. To see a list of all the available commands run `/help` when running the CLI.

### Settings and Configuration

You can update your model, API key, and other preferences using the `/settings` command. Just
follow the prompts:

- **Basic settings**: Choose a provider/model and enter your API key.
- **Advanced settings**: Set custom models and toggle
  [memory condensation](/openhands/usage/settings/llm-settings#memory-condensation).

### MCP Server Management

<Note>
If you're upgrading from a version before release 1.0.0, you'll need to redo your MCP server configuration as the
format has changed from TOML to JSON.
</Note>

The CLI provides two ways to manage MCP servers:
1. **CLI commands** (`openhands mcp`) - Manage servers from the command line
2. **Interactive command** (`/mcp`) - View server status within a conversation

#### CLI Commands

Manage MCP servers directly from your terminal:

```bash
# List all configured servers
openhands mcp list

# Get details for a specific server
openhands mcp get <server-name>

# Remove a server
openhands mcp remove <server-name>

# Enable/disable a server
openhands mcp enable <server-name>
openhands mcp disable <server-name>
```

#### Adding HTTP/SSE Servers

Add remote servers with HTTP or SSE transport:

```bash
# Add with Bearer token authentication
openhands mcp add my-api --transport http \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  https://api.example.com/mcp

# Add with API key authentication
openhands mcp add weather-api --transport http \
  --header "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  https://weather.api.com

# Add with multiple headers
openhands mcp add secure-api --transport http \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer token123" \
  --header "X-Client-ID: client456" \
  https://api.example.com

# Add with OAuth authentication
openhands mcp add notion-server --transport http \
  --auth oauth \
  https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
```

#### Adding Local Stdio Servers

Add local servers that communicate via stdio:

```bash
# Add a stdio server with environment variables
openhands mcp add local-server --transport stdio \
  --env "API_KEY=secret123" \
  --env "DATABASE_URL=postgresql://..." \
  python -- -m my_mcp_server --config config.json

# Add in disabled state
openhands mcp add my-server --transport stdio --disabled \
  node -- my-server.js
```

#### Example: Adding Web Search Capability

To add web search capability, you can use [Tavily's remote MCP server](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/mcp):

```bash
openhands mcp add tavily --transport stdio \
  npx -- -y mcp-remote "https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=<your-api-key>"
```

Alternatively, manually create or edit `~/.openhands/mcp.json` using [this configuration format](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client#configuration-format):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tavily-remote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=<your-api-key>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Interactive `/mcp` Command

The `/mcp` command within a conversation provides a read-only view of MCP server status:

- **View active servers**: Shows which MCP servers are currently active in the conversation
- **View pending changes**: If the `mcp.json` file has been modified, shows which servers will be mounted when the
  conversation is restarted

## Tips and Troubleshooting

- Use `/help` at any time to see the list of available commands.
- If you encounter permission issues, make sure your workspace directory is trusted and all required environment
  variables are set correctly.
- If you want to start over, use `/new` to begin a fresh conversation without restarting the CLI.
