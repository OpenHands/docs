## Available Commands

The OpenHands CLI provides commands to help with settings and conversations. These commands work by typing `/`
followed by the command. To see a list of all the available commands run `/help` when running the CLI.

### Settings and Configuration

You can update your model, API key, and other preferences using the `/settings` command. Just
follow the prompts:

- **Basic settings**: Choose a provider/model and enter your API key.
- **Advanced settings**: Set custom models and toggle
  [memory condensation](/openhands/usage/settings/llm-settings#memory-condensation).

### MCP Server Management

<Note>
If you're upgrading from a version before release 1.0.0, you'll need to redo your MCP server configuration as the
format has changed from TOML to JSON.
</Note>

To configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, you need to manually create and configure the
`~/.openhands/mcp.json` file using [this configuration format](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client#configuration-format).

**Example: Adding Web Search Capability**

To add web search capability within your OpenHands CLI, we can use [Tavily's remote MCP server](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/mcp) for AI-powered search and data extraction. To do so, you would create or edit `~/.openhands/mcp.json` with the following, adding your Tavily API key in the appropriate place:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tavily-remote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.tavily.com/mcp/?tavilyApiKey=<your-api-key>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
The `/mcp` command in the CLI provides a read-only view of MCP server status:

- **View active servers**: Shows which MCP servers are currently active in the conversation.
- **View pending changes**: If the `mcp.json` file has been modified, shows which servers will be mounted when the
  conversation is restarted.

## Skills Configuration

Skills are specialized prompts that provide domain-specific knowledge to OpenHands. They are markdown files (`.md`) that can be always-active or keyword-triggered, and they inject additional context and rules into the agent's behavior.

### Skills-related Environment Variables

- `AGENT_ENABLE_PROMPT_EXTENSIONS` - Enable/disable skills (default: `true`)
- `AGENT_DISABLED_MICROAGENTS` - List of specific skills to disable

## Tips and Troubleshooting

- Use `/help` at any time to see the list of available commands.
- If you encounter permission issues, make sure your workspace directory is trusted and all required environment
  variables are set correctly.
- If you want to start over, use `/new` to begin a fresh conversation without restarting the CLI.
