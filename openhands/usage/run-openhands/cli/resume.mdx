description: How to resume previous conversations in the OpenHands CLI
---

## Overview

OpenHands CLI automatically saves your conversation history in `~/.openhands/conversations`. You can resume any previous conversation to continue where you left off.

## Listing Previous Conversations

To see a list of your recent conversations, run:

```bash
openhands --resume
```

This displays up to 15 recent conversations with their IDs, timestamps, and a preview of the first user message:

```
Recent Conversations:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. abc123def456 (2h ago)
    Fix the login bug in auth.py

 2. xyz789ghi012 (yesterday)
    Add unit tests for the user service

 3. mno345pqr678 (3 days ago)
    Refactor the database connection module
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To resume a conversation, use: openhands --resume <conversation-id>
```

## Resuming a Specific Conversation

To resume a specific conversation, use the `--resume` flag with the conversation ID:

```bash
openhands --resume <conversation-id>
```

For example:

```bash
openhands --resume abc123def456
```

## Resuming the Latest Conversation

To quickly resume your most recent conversation without looking up the ID, use the `--last` flag:

```bash
openhands --resume --last
```

This automatically finds and resumes the most recent conversation.

## How It Works

When you resume a conversation:

1. OpenHands loads the full conversation history from disk
2. The agent has access to all previous context, including:
   - Your previous messages and requests
   - The agent's responses and actions
   - Any files that were created or modified
3. You can continue the conversation as if you never left

<Note>
The conversation history is stored locally on your machine. If you delete the `~/.openhands/conversations` directory, your conversation history will be lost.
</Note>

## Tips

- **Copy the conversation ID**: When you exit a conversation, OpenHands displays the conversation ID. You can copy this for later use.
- **Use descriptive first messages**: The conversation list shows a preview of your first message, so starting with a clear description helps you identify conversations later.
- **Combine with other flags**: You can combine `--resume` with other flags like `--always-approve` or `--llm-approve`:

```bash
openhands --resume abc123def456 --llm-approve
```
