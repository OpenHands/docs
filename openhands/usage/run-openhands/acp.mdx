description: Use OpenHands CLI with code editors through the Agent Client Protocol
---

<Warning>
This feature is experimental and may have limitations. Please report any issues you encounter on [OpenHands-CLI repo](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands-CLI/issues).
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before using OpenHands CLI with ACP, you must first install and configure the CLI:

1. **Install OpenHands CLI** by following the [CLI Mode installation instructions](/openhands/usage/run-openhands/cli-mode)
2. **Configure your LLM settings** using the `/settings` command

The ACP integration will reuse the credentials and configuration from your CLI settings.

## What is the Agent Client Protocol (ACP)?

The [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/overview) is a standardized communication protocol that enables code editors and IDEs to interact with AI agents. ACP defines how clients (like code editors) and agents (like OpenHands) communicate through a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface.
For more details about the protocol, see the [ACP documentation](https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/overview).

## ACP Support in OpenHands CLI

OpenHands CLI implements the Agent Client Protocol, allowing you to use OpenHands directly within your code editor. When you configure your editor to use `openhands acp`, it will communicate with OpenHands through the standardized ACP interface.

OpenHands CLI currently supports the following ACP features:

**✅ Implemented:**
- Initialization - version negotiation and capability exchange
- Session Setup - creating new sessions and loading existing ones
- Content - including embedded content and resources
- Prompt Turns - sending prompts and receiving responses (permissions coming soon)
- Tool Calls - executing tools and returning results
- Agent Plan - sharing agent's planned actions

**🚧 Coming Soon:**
- Confirmation - user authorization for tool calls
- Slash Commands - for changing confirmation mode

Feel free to open issues on the [OpenHands-CLI repo](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands-CLI/issues) if you have feature requests or encounter any problems.

[Zed](https://zed.dev/) is a high-performance code editor with built-in support for the Agent Client Protocol.

To configure OpenHands CLI with Zed:

1. Ensure OpenHands CLI is installed and configured (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites))

2. Open your Zed editor, use `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) to open the command palette, and search for `agent: open settings`

3. Then on the right side, click on `+ Add Agent` and select `Add Custom Agent`

4. Add the following to the `"agent_servers"` field:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "OpenHands": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "openhands",
        "acp"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```


4. Save the file

5. You can now use OpenHands within Zed!
