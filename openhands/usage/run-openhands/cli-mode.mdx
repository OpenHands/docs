description: The Command-Line Interface (CLI) provides a powerful interface that lets you engage with OpenHands
  directly from your terminal.

## Overview
This mode is different from the [headless mode](/openhands/usage/run-openhands/headless-mode), which is non-interactive
and better for scripting.

<Note>
If you're upgrading from a CLI version before release 1.0.0, you'll need to redo your settings setup as the
configuration format has changed.

## Getting Started

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using uv (recommended)">
    Requires Python 3.12+ and uv installed.

    ```bash
    uvx --python 3.12 openhands
    ```

    <Accordion title="Create shell aliases for easy access across environments">

    Add the following to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

    ```bash
    alias openhands="uvx --python 3.12 openhands"
    alias oh="uvx --python 3.12 openhands"
    ```

    After adding these lines, reload your shell configuration with `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` (depending on your shell).

    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Executable Binary">
      1. Download the executable binary from
     [OpenHands release page](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands/releases/tag/1.0.1-cli) and rename it to
     `openhands` for simplicity.

      2. Make it executable:
      ```bash
      chmod +x ./openhands
      ```

      3. Run the executable:
      ```bash
      ./openhands
      ```

    <Note>
      Your system may require you to allow permissions to run the executable.

      <Accordion title="MacOS">
        We are working on a fix for this issue.

        When running the OpenHands CLI on Mac, you will get a warning that says "openhands can't be opened because Apple
        cannot check it for malicious software."

        1. Open `System Settings`.
        2. Go to `Privacy & Security`.
        3. Scroll down to `Security` and click `Allow Anyway`.
        4. Rerun the OpenHands CLI.

      </Accordion>
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using Docker">
    1. Set the following environment variable in your terminal:
       - `SANDBOX_VOLUMES` to specify the directory you want OpenHands to access ([See using SANDBOX_VOLUMES for more info](/openhands/usage/runtimes/docker#using-sandbox_volumes))

    2. Ensure you have configured your settings before starting:
       - Set up `~/.openhands/settings.json` with your LLM configuration

    3. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -it \
        --pull=always \
        -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.openhands.dev/openhands/runtime:0.60-nikolaik \
        -e SANDBOX_USER_ID=$(id -u) \
        -e SANDBOX_VOLUMES=$SANDBOX_VOLUMES \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v ~/.openhands:/root/.openhands \
        --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
        --name openhands-cli-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) \
        python:3.12-slim \
        bash -c "pip install uv && uvx --python 3.12 openhands"
    ```

    The `-e SANDBOX_USER_ID=$(id -u)` is passed to the Docker command to ensure the sandbox user matches the host user’s
    permissions. This prevents the agent from creating root-owned files in the mounted workspace.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The first time you run the CLI, it will take you through configuring the required LLM settings. These will be saved
for future sessions.

The conversation history will be saved in `~/.openhands/conversations`.

## Interactive CLI Overview

### What is CLI Mode?

CLI mode enables real-time interaction with OpenHands through the terminal. You can type natural language tasks,
use interactive commands, and receive instant feedback—all inside your terminal.

### Available Commands

The OpenHands CLI provides commands to help with settings and conversations. These commands work by typing `/`
followed by the command. To see a list of all the available commands run `/help` when running the CLI.

#### Settings and Configuration

You can update your model, API key, and other preferences using the `/settings` command. Just
follow the prompts:

- **Basic settings**: Choose a provider/model and enter your API key.
- **Advanced settings**: Set custom models and toggle
  [memory condensation](/openhands/usage/settings/llm-settings#memory-condensation).

#### MCP Server Management

<Note>
If you're upgrading from a version before release 1.0.0, you'll need to redo your MCP server configuration as the
format has changed from TOML to JSON.
</Note>

To configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, you need to manually create and configure the
`~/.openhands/mcp.json` file using [this configuration format](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client#configuration-format).

The `/mcp` command in the CLI provides a read-only view of MCP server status:

- **View active servers**: Shows which MCP servers are currently active in the conversation.
- **View pending changes**: If the `mcp.json` file has been modified, shows which servers will be mounted when the
  conversation is restarted.

## Tips and Troubleshooting

- Use `/help` at any time to see the list of available commands.
- If you encounter permission issues, make sure your workspace directory is trusted and all required environment
  variables are set correctly.
- If you want to start over, use `/new` to begin a fresh conversation without restarting the CLI.
