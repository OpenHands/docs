description: The Command-Line Interface (CLI) provides a powerful interface that lets you engage with OpenHands
  directly from your terminal.

## Overview
This mode is different from the [headless mode](/openhands/usage/run-openhands/headless-mode), which is non-interactive
and better for scripting.

<Note>
If you're upgrading from a CLI version before release 1.0.0, you'll need to redo your settings setup as the
configuration format has changed.

## Getting Started

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using uv (recommended)">
    Requires Python 3.12+ and uv installed.

    **Install OpenHands:**
    ```bash
    uv tool install openhands --python 3.12
    ```

    **Run OpenHands:**
    ```bash
    openhands
    ```

    **Upgrade OpenHands:**
    ```bash
    uv tool upgrade openhands --python 3.12
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Executable Binary">
      1. Download the executable binary from the
     [OpenHands CLI release page](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands-CLI/releases/latest) and rename it to
     `openhands` for simplicity.

      2. Make it executable:
      ```bash
      chmod +x ./openhands
      ```

      3. Run the executable:
      ```bash
      ./openhands
      ```

    <Note>
      Your system may require you to allow permissions to run the executable.

      <Accordion title="MacOS">
        We are working on a fix for this issue.

        When running the OpenHands CLI on Mac, you will get a warning that says "openhands can't be opened because Apple
        cannot check it for malicious software."

        1. Open `System Settings`.
        2. Go to `Privacy & Security`.
        3. Scroll down to `Security` and click `Allow Anyway`.
        4. Rerun the OpenHands CLI.

      </Accordion>
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Using Docker">
    1. Set the following environment variable in your terminal:
       - `SANDBOX_VOLUMES` to specify the directory you want OpenHands to access ([See using SANDBOX_VOLUMES for more info](/openhands/usage/runtimes/docker#using-sandbox_volumes))

    2. Ensure you have configured your settings before starting:
       - Set up `~/.openhands/settings.json` with your LLM configuration

    3. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -it \
        --pull=always \
        -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.openhands.dev/openhands/runtime:0.62-nikolaik \
        -e SANDBOX_USER_ID=$(id -u) \
        -e SANDBOX_VOLUMES=$SANDBOX_VOLUMES \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v ~/.openhands:/root/.openhands \
        --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
        --name openhands-cli-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) \
        python:3.12-slim \
        bash -c "pip install uv && uv tool install openhands --python 3.12 && openhands"
    ```

    The `-e SANDBOX_USER_ID=$(id -u)` is passed to the Docker command to ensure the sandbox user matches the host user’s
    permissions. This prevents the agent from creating root-owned files in the mounted workspace.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The first time you run the CLI, it will take you through configuring the required LLM settings. These will be saved
for future sessions.

The conversation history will be saved in `~/.openhands/conversations`.

## Interactive CLI Overview

### What is CLI Mode?

CLI mode enables real-time interaction with OpenHands through the terminal. You can type natural language tasks,
use interactive commands, and receive instant feedback—all inside your terminal.

## CLI Options and Arguments

The OpenHands CLI supports various command-line options to customize your experience:

### Basic Options

- `--version` or `-v`: Display the CLI version
- `--task "your task"`: Start the CLI with an initial task message
- `--file path/to/file`: Start the CLI with a specific file context
- `--headless`: Run in headless mode with auto-exit functionality
- `--exit-without-confirmation`: Exit without confirmation prompts

### Experimental UI

<Note>
The experimental UI is available starting from CLI version 1.5.0 and provides an enhanced terminal experience.
</Note>

Enable the experimental UI with the `--exp` flag:

```bash
openhands --exp
```

**Experimental UI Features:**
- **Enhanced Visual Experience**: Consistent dark mode CLI UI that overrides light-themed terminals
- **Loading Indicators**: Spinner animations for long-running commands
- **Smart Queuing**: Queue prompts while the agent is running to avoid interruptions
- **File Search**: Use the `@` macro to search and reference files in your project
- **Collapsible Messages**: Reduced verbosity with optionally collapsible CLI messages
- **Multi-line Support**: Improved multi-line input handling with automatic paste detection

### Approval and Confirmation Modes

Control how the CLI handles agent actions:

- `--always-approve`: Automatically approve all agent actions without prompting
- `--llm-approve`: Use the LLM to automatically approve actions based on context



## Skills and Capabilities

The CLI automatically loads and provides access to:

- **Project Skills**: Custom skills defined in your project's `.openhands/skills/` directory
- **User Skills**: Personal skills from `~/.openhands/skills/`
- **Public Skills**: Community-contributed skills from the OpenHands skills repository
- **Legacy Microagents**: Backward compatibility with existing microagent configurations

## Version Management

The CLI includes automatic version checking and will prompt you when updates are available. You can check your current version with:

```bash
openhands --version
```
