title: CLI (V1)
description: The Command-Line Interface (CLI) provides a powerful interface that lets you engage with OpenHands
  directly from your terminal.
---

This mode is different from the [headless mode](/openhands/usage/run-openhands/headless-mode), which is non-interactive and better
for scripting.

<Note>
If you're upgrading from a CLI version before release 1.X.X, you'll need to redo your settings setup as the configuration format has changed.

## Getting Started

### Using Executable Binary (Recommended)

1. **Download the executable binary** from [https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/releases](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/releases)

2. **Make it executable**:
```bash
chmod +x ./openhands
```

3. **Run the executable**:
```bash
./openhands
```

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Alternative: Using uv">

Requires Python 3.12+ and uv installed.

```bash
uvx --python 3.12 openhands
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Alternative: pip installation">

```bash
pip install openhands
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create shell aliases for easy access across environments">

Add the following to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
# Add OpenHands aliases (recommended)
alias openhands="uvx --python 3.12 openhands"
alias oh="uvx --python 3.12 openhands"
```

After adding these lines, reload your shell configuration with `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` (depending on your shell).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Install OpenHands in home directory without global installation">

You can install OpenHands in a virtual environment in your home directory using `uv`:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment in your home directory
cd ~
uv venv .openhands-venv --python 3.12

# Install OpenHands in the virtual environment
uv pip install -t ~/.openhands-venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages openhands

# Add the bin directory to your PATH in your shell configuration file
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.openhands-venv/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc

# Reload your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

3. Set your model, API key, and other preferences using the UI (or alternatively environment variables, below).

This command opens an interactive prompt where you can type tasks or commands and get responses from OpenHands.
The first time you run the CLI, it will take you through configuring the required LLM
settings. These will be saved for future sessions.

The conversation history will be saved in `~/.openhands/conversations`.

### Running with Docker

1. Set the following environment variable in your terminal:
   - `SANDBOX_VOLUMES` to specify the directory you want OpenHands to access ([See using SANDBOX_VOLUMES for more info](/openhands/usage/runtimes/docker#using-sandbox_volumes))

2. Ensure you have configured your settings before starting:
   - Set up `~/.openhands/settings.json` with your LLM configuration
   - Optionally configure `~/.openhands/mcp.json` for MCP servers

3. Run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it \
    --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.58-nikolaik \
    -e SANDBOX_USER_ID=$(id -u) \
    -e SANDBOX_VOLUMES=$SANDBOX_VOLUMES \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.openhands:/root/.openhands \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-cli-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S) \
    python:3.12-slim \
    bash -c "pip install uv && uvx --python 3.12 openhands"
```

This launches the CLI in Docker, allowing you to interact with OpenHands.

The `-e SANDBOX_USER_ID=$(id -u)` is passed to the Docker command to ensure the sandbox user matches the host user’s
permissions. This prevents the agent from creating root-owned files in the mounted workspace.

The conversation history will be saved in `~/.openhands/sessions`.

## Interactive CLI Overview

### What is CLI Mode?

CLI mode enables real-time interaction with OpenHands agents. You can type natural language tasks, use interactive
commands, and receive instant feedback—all inside your terminal.

### Starting a Conversation

When you start the CLI, you'll see a welcome message and a prompt (`>`). Enter your first task or type a command to
begin your conversation.

### Available Commands

You can use the following commands whenever the prompt (`>`) is displayed:

| Command      | Description                                                    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/help`      | Show all available interactive commands and their descriptions |
| `/exit`      | Exit the application                                           |
| `/status`    | Show conversation details and usage metrics                    |
| `/new`       | Start a new conversation                                       |
| `/settings`  | View and modify current LLM/agent settings                     |
| `/resume`    | Resume the agent if paused                                     |
| `/mcp`       | View active MCP servers and pending configuration changes     |

#### Settings and Configuration

You can update your model, API key, agent, and other preferences interactively using the `/settings` command. Just
follow the prompts:

- **Basic settings**: Choose a model/provider and enter your API key.
- **Advanced settings**: Set custom endpoints, enable or disable confirmation mode, and configure memory condensation.

Settings can also be managed via the `~/.openhands/settings.json` file.

#### Agent Pause/Resume Feature

You can pause the agent while it is running by pressing `Ctrl-P`. To continue the conversation after pausing, simply
type `/resume` at the prompt.

#### MCP Server Management

<Note>
If you're upgrading from a version before release 1.X.X, you'll need to redo your MCP server configuration as the format has changed from TOML to JSON.
</Note>

To configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, you need to manually create and configure the `~/.openhands/mcp.json` file following the configuration format outlined at [https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client#configuration-format](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client#configuration-format).

The `/mcp` command in the CLI provides a read-only view of MCP server status:

- **View active servers**: Shows which MCP servers are currently active in the conversation
- **View pending changes**: If the mcp.json file has been modified, shows which servers will be mounted when the conversation is restarted

By default, the [Fetch MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch) will be automatically configured for OpenHands.

## Tips and Troubleshooting

- Use `/help` at any time to see the list of available commands.
- If you encounter permission issues, make sure your workspace directory is trusted and all required environment variables are set correctly.
- For advanced LLM configuration, use the advanced options in `/settings`.
- When confirmation mode is enabled, the CLI will prompt before sensitive operations. You can type `a` or `always` at the first confirmation prompt to automatically confirm subsequent actions for the current conversation.
- If you want to start over, use `/new` to begin a fresh conversation without restarting the CLI.
