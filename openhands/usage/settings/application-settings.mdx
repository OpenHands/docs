## Overview

The Application Settings page allows you to customize various application-level behaviors in OpenHands, including language preferences, notification settings, and custom Git author configuration for commits and Pull Requests.

## Git Settings

OpenHands provides the ability to customize the Git author information used when making commits and creating Pull Requests on your behalf.

By default, OpenHands uses the following Git author information for all commits and Pull Requests:

- **Username**: `openhands`
- **Email**: `openhands@all-hands.dev`

You can override these defaults by configuring custom Git author settings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Application Settings">
    Go to Settings > Application Settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate Git Settings Section">
    Scroll down to the "Git Settings" section on the Application Settings page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Username">
    Enter your preferred Git username in the "Git Username" field
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Email">
    Enter your preferred Git email address in the "Git Email" field
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click the "Save Changes" button to apply your custom Git settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  When you configure a custom Git author, OpenHands will use your specified username and email as the primary author for commits and Pull Requests. OpenHands will remain as a co-author.
