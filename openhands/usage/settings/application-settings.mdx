## Overview

The Application Settings page allows you to customize various application-level behaviors in OpenHands, including language preferences, notification settings, and custom Git author configuration for commits and Pull Requests.

## Git Settings

OpenHands provides the ability to customize the Git author information used when making commits and creating Pull Requests on your behalf.

### Custom Git Author

By default, OpenHands uses the following Git author information for all commits and Pull Requests:

- **Username**: `openhands`
- **Email**: `openhands@all-hands.dev`

You can override these defaults by configuring custom Git author settings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Application Settings">
    Go to Settings → OpenHands Settings → Application Settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate Git Settings Section">
    Scroll down to the "Git Settings" section on the Application Settings page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Username">
    Enter your preferred Git username in the "Git Username" field
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Email">
    Enter your preferred Git email address in the "Git Email" field
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click the "Save Changes" button to apply your custom Git settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  When you configure a custom Git author, OpenHands will use your specified username and email as the primary author for commits and Pull Requests. OpenHands will remain as a co-author, ensuring proper attribution of the AI assistance.
</Note>

### How It Works

When you set custom Git author information:

1. **Primary Author**: Your configured username and email become the primary author shown on commits and Pull Requests
2. **Co-Author**: OpenHands (`openhands <openhands@all-hands.dev>`) is automatically added as a co-author to maintain transparency about AI assistance
3. **Applies To**: All new commits and Pull Requests created after saving the settings

This co-authorship approach ensures:
- Proper attribution to you as the project contributor
- Transparency about AI assistance in the development process
- Compliance with contribution guidelines that require disclosure of AI usage

## Additional Settings

The Application Settings page also includes configuration options for:

- **Language**: Choose your preferred interface language
- **Analytics**: Opt in or out of anonymous usage analytics
- **Sound Notifications**: Enable or disable sound notifications for events
- **Maximum Budget per Conversation**: Set spending limits for API usage per conversation (if applicable)
