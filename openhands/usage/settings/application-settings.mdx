## Overview

The Application settings allows you to customize various application-level behaviors in OpenHands, including
language preferences, notification settings, custom Git author configuration and more.

## Git Author Settings

OpenHands provides the ability to customize the Git author information used when making commits and creating
pull requests on your behalf.

By default, OpenHands uses the following Git author information for all commits and pull requests:

- **Username**: `openhands`
- **Email**: `openhands@all-hands.dev`

To override the defaults:

1. Navigate to the `Settings > Application` page.
2. Under the `Git Settings` section, enter your preferred `Git Username` and `Git Email`.
3. Click `Save Changes`

<Note>
  When you configure a custom Git author, OpenHands will use your specified username and email as the primary author
  for commits and pull requests. OpenHands will remain as a co-author.
