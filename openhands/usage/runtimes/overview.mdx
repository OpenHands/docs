title: Overview
description: This section covers the different sandbox and runtime options available for OpenHands.

<Note>
  These settings are only available in [Local GUI](/openhands/usage/run-openhands/local-setup). OpenHands Cloud uses managed sandbox environments.
</Note>

A Runtime is an environment where the OpenHands agent can edit files and run
commands. OpenHands supports multiple sandboxing options to fit different security requirements and deployment scenarios.

## Choosing a Runtime

| Runtime | Sandbox Type | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| [Docker Runtime](/usage/runtimes/docker) | Docker container | Most users (default, recommended) |
| [Remote Runtime](/usage/runtimes/remote) | Cloud sandbox | Parallel workloads, managed infrastructure |
| [Local Runtime](/usage/runtimes/local) | No sandbox | CI/CD pipelines, development, controlled environments |

### Run in a Docker Sandbox (Default)

The [Docker Runtime](/usage/runtimes/docker) creates isolated Docker containers for the agent to execute commands.
This is the recommended option for most users as it provides strong isolation while keeping everything local.

<Note>
The Docker Runtime requires mounting the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) so OpenHands can create sandbox containers.
This gives OpenHands access to the Docker daemon. If you prefer not to expose the Docker daemon, consider the
[Remote Runtime](/usage/runtimes/remote) for cloud-based sandboxing or the [Local Runtime](/usage/runtimes/local) for no sandboxing.
</Note>

### Run on the Cloud

The [Remote Runtime](/usage/runtimes/remote) connects to cloud-based sandbox environments.
This is ideal for parallel execution, managed infrastructure, or when you don't want to run sandboxes locally.

### Run Without Sandboxing

The [Local Runtime](/usage/runtimes/local) runs the agent directly on your machine (or inside the OpenHands container)
without any sandbox isolation. This is useful for CI/CD pipelines, development workflows, or environments where
container-based sandboxing is not available.

<Warning>
Running without sandboxing means the agent has direct access to your filesystem and can execute commands
without isolation. Only use this in controlled environments where you understand the security implications.
</Warning>

### Run in an Apptainer Sandbox

[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) (formerly Singularity) is a container runtime designed for HPC environments that can run
without root privileges and without exposing a daemon socket. OpenHands does not currently have a built-in Apptainer runtime,
but this would be a welcome community contribution. See the [third-party runtimes](#third-party-runtimes) section for how
custom runtimes can be integrated.

## Available Runtimes

- [Docker Runtime](/usage/runtimes/docker) - Run in a Docker sandbox (recommended for most users).
- [Remote Runtime](/usage/runtimes/remote) - Run on the cloud with managed sandboxes (beta).
- [Local Runtime](/usage/runtimes/local) - Run without sandboxing, directly on your machine.

### Third-Party Runtimes

The following third-party runtimes are available when you install the `third_party_runtimes` extra:

```bash
pip install openhands-ai[third_party_runtimes]
```

- [E2B Runtime](/usage/runtimes/e2b) - Open source runtime using E2B sandboxes.
- [Modal Runtime](/usage/runtimes/modal) - Serverless runtime using Modal infrastructure.
- [Runloop Runtime](/usage/runtimes/runloop) - Cloud runtime using Runloop infrastructure.
- [Daytona Runtime](/usage/runtimes/daytona) - Development environment runtime using Daytona.

**Note**: These third-party runtimes are supported by their respective developers, not by the OpenHands team. For issues specific to these runtimes, please refer to their documentation or contact their support teams.
