title: Workspace & Session Tools
description: Understanding the OpenHands workspace and available session tools
---

## Overview

When you start an OpenHands session, you're working within a managed workspace that provides various tools for development. This guide explains how to use these tools effectively.

## The Workspace

### What is the Workspace?

The workspace is the environment where OpenHands operates. Depending on your setup:

| Setup | Workspace Location |
|-------|-------------------|
| CLI with `--mount-cwd` | Your current directory mounted at `/workspace` |
| Local GUI | Mounted project directory |
| OpenHands Cloud | Cloned repository in isolated environment |

### Workspace Persistence

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    Changes are made directly to your mounted directory and persist after the session ends.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cloud">
    Changes persist within the session and can be committed to a branch or PR.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Working with Files

The agent can:
- **Read** any file in the workspace
- **Create** new files and directories
- **Modify** existing files
- **Delete** files when necessary
- **Search** across the codebase

<Tip>
The agent sees your project as you do. If a file is in your `.gitignore`, the agent can still access it but may not include it in commits.
</Tip>

## Terminal / Shell

### Real-Time Command Execution

Watch commands execute in real-time:

```
Agent: Running `npm test`
───────────────────────────────────────
> project@1.0.0 test
> jest

PASS  src/tests/user.test.js
PASS  src/tests/auth.test.js

Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       12 passed, 12 total
───────────────────────────────────────
```

### Common Operations

The agent typically uses the terminal for:

| Operation | Example Commands |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Installing dependencies | `npm install`, `pip install` |
| Running tests | `npm test`, `pytest` |
| Building projects | `npm run build`, `make` |
| Linting | `npm run lint`, `flake8` |
| Git operations | `git status`, `git diff` |
| File operations | `ls`, `cat`, `find` |

### Monitoring Output

Pay attention to terminal output for:
- **Errors**: The agent will attempt to fix them
- **Warnings**: May indicate potential issues
- **Test results**: Verify expected behavior
- **Build output**: Check for successful compilation

<Warning>
If you see the agent running commands that seem incorrect, you can interrupt and provide guidance.
</Warning>

## Code Editor

### Viewing Changes

In the web interface, the code editor shows:
- Currently open files
- Syntax highlighting
- Line numbers
- Diff view for changes

### Change Tracking

The agent tracks all modifications:

```diff
// Original
function processData(data) {
-  return data;
+  return data.map(item => ({
+    ...item,
+    processed: true
+  }));
}
```

### Manual Editing

You can make manual edits alongside the agent:
1. Pause the agent if running
2. Make your changes
3. Resume or provide new instructions

<Tip>
If you make manual changes, mention them to the agent so it can incorporate them into its context.
</Tip>

## Browser Tool

### Web Testing

For web development tasks, the browser tool enables:
- **Preview**: View your application
- **Interaction**: Click, type, navigate
- **Screenshots**: Capture current state
- **Console**: Monitor browser logs

### Use Cases

| Task | How the Agent Uses Browser |
|------|---------------------------|
| UI Development | Preview components, verify layout |
| Testing | Interact with forms, verify functionality |
| Debugging | Check console errors, network requests |
| Screenshot | Capture states for verification |

### Example Workflow

```
1. Agent makes UI changes
2. Agent opens browser to http://localhost:3000
3. Agent navigates to the modified page
4. Agent verifies the changes look correct
5. Agent reports success or makes adjustments
```

## Progress Tracking

### Session Timeline

The session maintains a history of:
- Commands executed
- Files modified
- Decisions made
- Errors encountered

### Status Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 🔄 Running | Agent is executing a step |
| ⏸️ Paused | Agent is waiting for input |
| ✅ Complete | Task finished successfully |
| ❌ Error | An error occurred |
| ⏳ Thinking | Agent is planning next steps |

### Understanding Agent Behavior

The agent typically follows this pattern:

```
1. Read and understand the task
2. Explore relevant code
3. Plan the approach
4. Make changes
5. Test the changes
6. Iterate if needed
7. Report completion
```

## Taking Control

### Pausing the Agent

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    Press `Esc` to pause. The agent will stop after completing its current step.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Web/Cloud">
    Type a message to interrupt. The agent will acknowledge and await new instructions.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Running Your Own Commands

You can guide the agent to run specific commands:

```
"Please run `npm run test:integration` to verify the changes"
"Execute `docker-compose up -d` to start the services"
"Run `git diff` to show me what changed"
```

### Providing Corrections

If the agent is heading in the wrong direction:

```
❌ Don't: "That's wrong"
✅ Do: "Stop. Instead of modifying user.js, please update the auth.js file"
```

## Session Management

### Saving Progress

Your session state is automatically saved, including:
- Conversation history
- Modified files
- Pending changes

### Resuming Sessions

In the CLI, resume previous work:

```bash
# List recent sessions
openhands --resume

# Resume the most recent
openhands --resume --last

# Resume a specific session
openhands --resume <session-id>
```

### Ending Sessions

When you're done:

| Action | CLI | Web/Cloud |
|--------|-----|-----------|
| Exit cleanly | `Ctrl+Q` or `/exit` | Close tab or click end |
| Create PR | Agent can do this | Use the PR button |
| Save state | Automatic | Automatic |

## Best Practices

### 1. Monitor Actively

Don't just start a task and walk away:
- Watch for errors or unexpected behavior
- Provide timely feedback
- Catch issues early

### 2. Use the Right Tool

Guide the agent to use appropriate tools:

```
"Use the terminal to run the tests"
"Preview the changes in the browser"
"Show me the diff of what you changed"
```

### 3. Verify Results

Always verify the agent's work:

```bash
# Check what changed
git diff

# Run tests
npm test

# Check for lint errors
npm run lint
```

### 4. Provide Context

Help the agent understand your workspace:

```
"The test database is at localhost:5432"
"Run tests with `npm run test:unit`"
"The main entry point is src/index.ts"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Seems Stuck

If the agent isn't making progress:
1. Check if it's waiting for input
2. Provide more specific guidance
3. Break down the task into smaller steps

### Commands Failing

If commands fail:
- Check if dependencies are installed
- Verify the working directory
- Ensure required services are running

### Unexpected Changes

If you see unwanted changes:
1. Pause the agent
2. Use `git checkout -- <file>` to revert
3. Provide clearer instructions
