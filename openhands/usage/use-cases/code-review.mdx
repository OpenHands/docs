title: Automated Code Review
description: Set up automated PR reviews using OpenHands and the Software Agent SDK
---

Automated code review helps maintain code quality, catch bugs early, and enforce coding standards consistently across your team. OpenHands provides a GitHub Actions workflow powered by the [Software Agent SDK](/sdk/index) that automatically reviews pull requests and posts inline comments directly on your PRs.

## Overview

The OpenHands PR Review workflow is a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- **Triggers automatically** when PRs are opened or when you request a review
- **Analyzes code changes** in the context of your entire repository
- **Posts inline comments** directly on specific lines of code in the PR
- **Provides fast feedback** - typically within 2-3 minutes

## How It Works

The PR review workflow uses the OpenHands Software Agent SDK to analyze your code changes:

1. **Trigger**: The workflow runs when:
   - A new non-draft PR is opened
   - A draft PR is marked as ready for review
   - The `review-this` label is added to a PR
   - `openhands-agent` is requested as a reviewer

2. **Analysis**: The agent receives the complete PR diff and uses two skills:
   - **`/codereview`** or **`/codereview-roasted`**: Analyzes code for quality, security, and best practices
   - **`/github-pr-review`**: Posts structured inline comments via the GitHub API

3. **Output**: Review comments are posted directly on the PR with:
   - Priority labels (🔴 Critical, 🟠 Important, 🟡 Suggestion, 🟢 Nit)
   - Specific line references
   - Actionable suggestions with code examples

### Review Styles

Choose between two review styles:

| Style | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Standard** (`/codereview`) | Pragmatic, constructive feedback focusing on code quality, security, and best practices | Day-to-day code reviews |
| **Roasted** (`/codereview-roasted`) | Linus Torvalds-style brutally honest review emphasizing "good taste", data structures, and simplicity | Critical code paths, learning opportunities |

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy the workflow file">
    Create `.github/workflows/pr-review-by-openhands.yml` in your repository:

    ```yaml
    name: PR Review by OpenHands

    on:
      pull_request_target:
        types: [opened, ready_for_review, labeled, review_requested]

    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write

    jobs:
      pr-review:
        if: |
          (github.event.action == 'opened' && github.event.pull_request.draft == false) ||
          github.event.action == 'ready_for_review' ||
          github.event.label.name == 'review-this' ||
          github.event.requested_reviewer.login == 'openhands-agent'
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
          LLM_MODEL: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
          # Review style: 'standard' for pragmatic review, 'roasted' for Linus-style
          REVIEW_STYLE: standard
          PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
          PR_BODY: ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}
          PR_BASE_BRANCH: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
          PR_HEAD_BRANCH: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}
          REPO_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
        steps:

    Create a `review-this` label in your repository:
    1. Go to **Issues → Labels**
    2. Click **New label**
    3. Name: `review-this`
    4. Description: `Trigger OpenHands PR review`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger a review">
    Open a PR and either:
    - Add the `review-this` label, OR
    - Request `openhands-agent` as a reviewer
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customization

### Repository-Specific Review Guidelines

Create custom review guidelines for your repository by adding a skill file at `.openhands/skills/code-review.md`:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Custom code review guidelines for this repository
triggers:
- /codereview
---

# Repository Code Review Guidelines

You are reviewing code for [Your Project Name]. Follow these guidelines:

## Review Decisions

### When to APPROVE
- Configuration changes following existing patterns
- Documentation-only changes
- Test-only changes without production code changes
- Simple additions following established conventions

### When to COMMENT
- Issues that need attention (bugs, security concerns)
- Suggestions for improvement
- Questions about design decisions

## Core Principles

1. **[Your Principle 1]**: Description
2. **[Your Principle 2]**: Description

## What to Check

- **[Category 1]**: What to look for
- **[Category 2]**: What to look for

## Repository Conventions

- Use [your linter] for style checking
- Follow [your style guide]
- Tests should be in [your test directory]
```

<Note>
The skill file must use `/codereview` as the trigger to override the default review behavior.
</Note>

### Workflow Configuration

Customize the workflow by modifying the `env` section:

```yaml
env:
  # Change the LLM model
  LLM_MODEL: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
  
  # Use a custom LLM endpoint
  LLM_BASE_URL: https://your-llm-proxy.example.com
  
  # Switch to "roasted" style for brutally honest reviews
  REVIEW_STYLE: roasted
```

### Trigger Customization

Modify when reviews are triggered by editing the workflow conditions:

```yaml
# Only trigger on label (disable auto-review on PR open)
if: github.event.label.name == 'review-this'

# Only trigger when specific reviewer is requested
if: github.event.requested_reviewer.login == 'openhands-agent'

# Trigger on all PRs (including drafts)
if: |
  github.event.action == 'opened' ||
  github.event.action == 'synchronize'
```

## Security Considerations

The workflow uses `pull_request_target` to safely handle fork PRs:

- **Secrets are protected**: The workflow runs in the base repository context
- **PR code is isolated**: The PR branch is checked out without persisting credentials
- **Maintainer control**: Only users with write access can trigger reviews via labels or reviewer requests
- **First-time contributors**: PRs from first-time contributors require manual trigger for safety

<Warning>
Always review PRs from unknown contributors before triggering automated reviews to ensure the code is safe to analyze.
</Warning>

## What Gets Reviewed

The agent analyzes your code changes across multiple dimensions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Code Quality">
    - Complexity and nesting depth
    - Code duplication
    - Function size and responsibility
    - Naming clarity
    - Documentation completeness
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Security">
    - Input validation
    - SQL injection risks
    - Hardcoded secrets
    - Authentication/authorization issues
    - Cryptographic misuse
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Best Practices">
    - Error handling
    - Resource cleanup
    - Type safety
    - Testing coverage
    - Backward compatibility
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Example Review Output

Here's what a typical review comment looks like:

```
🟠 Important: This function doesn't handle the case where `user` is None,
which could cause an AttributeError on line 45.

```suggestion
if user is None:
    raise ValueError("User cannot be None")
return user.name
```
```

The agent uses GitHub's suggestion syntax, allowing you to apply fixes with a single click.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review not triggering">
    - Ensure the `LLM_API_KEY` secret is set correctly
    - Check that the label name matches exactly (`review-this`)
    - Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
    - Check the Actions tab for workflow run errors
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review comments not appearing">
    - Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `pull-requests: write` permission
    - Check the workflow logs for API errors
    - Verify the PR is not from a fork with restricted permissions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review taking too long">
    - Large PRs may take longer to analyze
    - Consider splitting large PRs into smaller ones
    - Check if the LLM API is experiencing delays
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
