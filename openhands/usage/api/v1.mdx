title: REST API (V1)
description: Overview of the current V1 REST endpoints used by the Web app.

<Note>
  OpenHands is in a transition period: legacy (V0) endpoints still exist alongside
  the new <code>/api/v1</code> endpoints.

  If you need the legacy OpenAPI reference, see the <b>Web (V0)</b> tab.
</Note>

## Overview

OpenHands V1 REST endpoints are mounted under:

- <code>/api/v1</code>

These endpoints back the current Web UI and are intended for newer integrations.

## Key resources

The V1 API is organized around a few core concepts:

- **App conversations**: create/list conversations and access conversation metadata.
  - <code>POST /api/v1/app-conversations</code>
  - <code>GET /api/v1/app-conversations</code>

- **Sandboxes**: list/start/pause/resume the execution environments that power conversations.
  - <code>GET /api/v1/sandboxes/search</code>
  - <code>POST /api/v1/sandboxes</code>
  - <code>POST /api/v1/sandboxes/{id}/pause</code>
  - <code>POST /api/v1/sandboxes/{id}/resume</code>

- **Sandbox specs**: list the available sandbox “templates” (e.g., Docker image presets).
  - <code>GET /api/v1/sandbox-specs/search</code>

## Notes on stability

The V1 API surface is still evolving. If you are building something that needs a
stable contract, consider starting with the legacy (V0) endpoints while we
finish the V1 migration, and keep an eye on release notes for breaking changes.
