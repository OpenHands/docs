description: Run conversations in a remote sandbox environment.

A **remote sandbox** runs the agent server in a remote execution environment
instead of on your local machine.

This is typically used by managed deployments (e.g., OpenHands Cloud) and
advanced self-hosted setups.

## Selecting remote mode

In some self-hosted deployments, remote sandboxes are selected via the legacy
<code>RUNTIME</code> environment variable:

```bash
export RUNTIME=remote
```

Remote sandboxes require additional configuration (API URL + API key). The exact
variable names depend on your deployment, but you may see legacy names like:

- <code>SANDBOX_REMOTE_RUNTIME_API_URL</code>
- <code>SANDBOX_API_KEY</code>

## Notes

- Remote sandboxes may expose additional service URLs (e.g., VS Code, app ports)
  depending on the provider.
- Configuration and credentials vary by deployment.

If you are using OpenHands Cloud, see the [Cloud UI guide](/openhands/usage/cloud/cloud-ui).
