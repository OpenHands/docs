description: Run conversations in a remote sandbox environment.

A **remote sandbox** runs the agent server in a remote execution environment
instead of on your local machine.

This is typically used by managed deployments (e.g., OpenHands Cloud) and
advanced self-hosted setups.

## Notes

- Remote sandboxes may expose additional service URLs (e.g., VS Code, app ports)
  depending on the provider.
- Configuration and credentials vary by deployment.

If you are using OpenHands Cloud, see the [Cloud UI guide](/openhands/usage/cloud/cloud-ui).
