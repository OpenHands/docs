title: Process Sandbox (Unsafe)
description: Run the agent server as a local process without container isolation.
---

The **Process sandbox** runs the agent server directly on your machine as a
regular process.

<Warning>
  This mode provides **no sandbox isolation**.

  The agent can read/write files your user account can access and execute
  commands on your host system.

  Only use this in controlled environments.
</Warning>

## When to use it

- Local development when Docker is unavailable
- Some CI environments
- Debugging issues that only reproduce outside containers

## Choosing process mode

Exact configuration depends on how you run OpenHands (CLI launcher, Docker, or
a self-hosted deployment). In some setups this may still be exposed under a
legacy “runtime” selector.

If you are unsure, prefer the [Docker Sandbox](/openhands/usage/sandboxes/docker).
