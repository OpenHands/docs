title: Process Sandbox (Unsafe)
description: Run the agent server as a local process without container isolation.
---

The **Process sandbox** runs the agent server directly on your machine as a
regular process.

<Warning>
  This mode provides **no sandbox isolation**.

  The agent can read/write files your user account can access and execute
  commands on your host system.

  Only use this in controlled environments.
</Warning>

## When to use it

- Local development when Docker is unavailable
- Some CI environments
- Debugging issues that only reproduce outside containers

## Choosing process mode

In some deployments, this is selected via the legacy <code>RUNTIME</code>
environment variable:

```bash
export RUNTIME=process
# (legacy alias)
# export RUNTIME=local
```

If you are unsure, prefer the [Docker Sandbox](/openhands/usage/sandboxes/docker).
