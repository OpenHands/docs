title: Overview
description: Where OpenHands runs code in V1: Docker sandbox, Process, or Remote.
---

A **sandbox** is the environment where OpenHands runs commands, edits files, and
starts servers while working on your task.

In **OpenHands V1**, we use the term **sandbox** (not “runtime”) for this concept.

## Sandbox providers

OpenHands supports multiple sandbox “providers”, with different tradeoffs:

- **Docker sandbox (recommended)**
  - Runs the agent server inside a Docker container.
  - Good isolation from your host machine.

- **Process sandbox (unsafe, but fast)**
  - Runs the agent server as a regular process on your machine.
  - No container isolation.

- **Remote sandbox**
  - Runs the agent server in a remote environment.
  - Used by managed deployments and some hosted setups.

## Terminology note (V0 vs V1)

Older documentation refers to these environments as **runtimes**.
Those legacy docs are now in the <b>Web_V0</b> tab.
