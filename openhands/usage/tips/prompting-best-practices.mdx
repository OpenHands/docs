title: Prompting Best Practices
description: When working with OpenHands AI software developer, providing clear and effective prompts is key to getting accurate and useful responses. This guide outlines best practices for crafting effective prompts.

## Characteristics of Good Prompts

Good prompts are:

- **Concrete**: Clearly describe what functionality should be added or what error needs fixing.
- **Location-specific**: Specify the locations in the codebase that should be modified, if known.
- **Appropriately scoped**: Focus on a single feature, typically not exceeding 100 lines of code.

## Examples

### Good Prompt Examples

- Add a function `calculate_average` in `utils/math_operations.py` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their average.
- Fix the TypeError in `frontend/src/components/UserProfile.tsx` occurring on line 42. The error suggests we're trying to access a property of undefined.
- Implement input validation for the email field in the registration form. Update `frontend/src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx` to check if the email is in a valid format before submission.

### Bad Prompt Examples

- Make the code better. (Too vague, not concrete)
- Rewrite the entire backend to use a different framework. (Not appropriately scoped)
- There's a bug somewhere in the user authentication. Can you find and fix it? (Lacks specificity and location information)

## Tips for Effective Prompting

- Be as specific as possible about the desired outcome or the problem to be solved.
- Provide context, including relevant file paths and line numbers if available.
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable prompts.
- Include relevant error messages or logs.
- Specify the programming language or framework, if not obvious.

The more precise and informative your prompt, the better OpenHands can assist you.

## Working with Multiple Repositories

When working on projects that span multiple repositories, you can instruct OpenHands to clone additional repositories using your Git provider token. This is particularly useful when you need OpenHands to be aware of code in related repositories.

### Common Scenarios

- **Frontend/Backend Split**: Starting in a `backend` repo but needing access to UI code in a `frontend` repo
- **Microservices**: Working across multiple service repositories
- **Shared Libraries**: Accessing common utilities or components from separate repositories

### Methods for Cloning Additional Repos

#### 1. Repository Configuration Files

You can include cloning instructions in your repository's configuration files:

- **`repo.md`**: Add instructions for OpenHands to clone related repositories
- **`agents.md`**: Include repository setup as part of agent initialization

Example in `repo.md`:
```markdown
## Related Repositories

Please clone the following related repositories for full context:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/frontend-repo.git ../frontend
git clone https://github.com/your-org/shared-utils.git ../shared-utils
```

#### 2. Ad-hoc Prompting

During a conversation, you can directly instruct OpenHands to clone additional repositories:

**Example prompts:**
- "Please clone our frontend repository from `https://github.com/our-org/frontend-repo.git` so you can see the UI components that interact with this API."
- "Clone the shared utilities repo at `https://github.com/our-org/utils.git` into a `../utils` directory so you can reference the helper functions."
- "I need you to access our documentation repo. Please clone `https://github.com/our-org/docs.git` to understand the API specifications."

### Best Practices for Multi-Repo Workflows

- **Specify clone location**: Use relative paths like `../repo-name` to keep repositories organized
- **Provide context**: Explain why the additional repository is needed
- **Use your Git token**: OpenHands will automatically use your configured Git provider token for authentication
- **Be explicit about relationships**: Describe how the repositories relate to each other

### Example Multi-Repo Prompt

```
I'm working on the user authentication API in this backend repo, but I need to understand how the frontend handles login flows. Please clone our frontend repository from https://github.com/our-company/frontend-app.git into ../frontend so you can see the login components and help me ensure the API responses match what the frontend expects.
```

This approach allows OpenHands to have full context across your entire project ecosystem, leading to better suggestions and more accurate implementations.
