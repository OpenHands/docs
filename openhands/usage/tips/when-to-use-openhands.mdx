# When to Use OpenHands

OpenHands excels at certain types of tasks. Understanding when to use it—and when not to—will help you get the best results.

## Ideal Use Cases

### 1. Well-Defined, Scoped Tasks

OpenHands performs best on tasks with clear boundaries and acceptance criteria:

- **Bug fixes** with specific reproduction steps
- **Feature additions** with clear requirements
- **Refactoring** with well-defined scope
- **Test writing** for existing functionality
- **Documentation updates** with specific content needs

### 2. Repetitive Engineering Tasks

Tasks you've done many times before:

- Adding unit tests to existing code
- Implementing CRUD endpoints
- Setting up boilerplate for new features
- Migrating code patterns across files
- Updating dependencies and fixing breaking changes

### 3. Code Exploration and Understanding

When you need to understand a codebase:

- Answering questions about how code works
- Finding where functionality is implemented
- Explaining complex code patterns
- Identifying dependencies between components

### 4. Parallel Task Execution

Running multiple independent tasks simultaneously:

- Fixing multiple independent bugs
- Adding tests across different modules
- Updating documentation in parallel
- Migrating multiple files with similar changes

## Less Ideal Use Cases

### Tasks Requiring External Context

OpenHands works best when context is available in the codebase:

<Warning>
**Challenging scenarios:**
- Tasks requiring proprietary business knowledge not in code
- Decisions needing stakeholder input
- Work depending on external systems without documentation
</Warning>

### Large-Scale Architectural Changes

For major restructuring, consider breaking work into phases:

- **Instead of**: "Rewrite the entire authentication system"
- **Try**: "Add JWT support to the existing auth module" → "Migrate user sessions to JWT" → "Remove legacy auth code"

### Highly Creative or Subjective Work

Tasks with subjective quality criteria may need more guidance:

- UI/UX design decisions
- Naming conventions without established patterns
- Architecture decisions without clear requirements

## Best Practices Checklist

Before starting a task, verify:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clear Acceptance Criteria">
    Can you describe what "done" looks like?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Testable Outcome">
    Can you verify the result programmatically or visually?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sufficient Context">
    Is the necessary information in the codebase or can you provide it?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Appropriate Scope">
    Is the task small enough to complete in one session?
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Task Complexity Guidelines

| Complexity | Example | Recommendation |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Simple** | Fix a typo, add a test | Single prompt, minimal guidance |
| **Medium** | Implement a feature, fix a bug | Provide context and acceptance criteria |
| **Complex** | Multi-file refactoring | Break into subtasks, provide detailed guidance |
| **Very Complex** | Architectural changes | Consider human-led design with OpenHands implementation |

## Maximizing Success

### 1. Provide Clear Instructions

Be specific about what you want:

```
❌ "Fix the login bug"
✅ "Fix the login bug where users see a blank page after clicking submit. 
    The error appears in the console as 'undefined is not a function'. 
    The bug was introduced in PR #123."
```

### 2. Include Verification Steps

Tell OpenHands how to verify its work:

```
✅ "After implementing, run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass, 
    and manually test by logging in with test credentials."
```

### 3. Set Boundaries

Define what should and shouldn't change:

```
✅ "Modify only files in the `src/auth/` directory. 
    Do not change the public API signatures."
```

## Getting Help

If you're unsure whether a task is suitable for OpenHands:

1. Start with a smaller version of the task
2. Provide more context than you think necessary
3. Use [iterative refinement](/sdk/guides/iterative-refinement) to improve results
4. Check the [prompting best practices](/openhands/usage/tips/prompting-best-practices) guide
