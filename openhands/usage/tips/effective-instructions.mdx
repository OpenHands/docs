# Writing Effective Instructions

The quality of OpenHands' output depends significantly on how you communicate your task. This guide covers techniques for writing clear, effective instructions.

## The Anatomy of a Good Instruction

A well-structured instruction includes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Context">
    Background information OpenHands needs to understand the task
  </Step>
  <Step title="Objective">
    What you want to accomplish
  </Step>
  <Step title="Constraints">
    Boundaries and limitations to work within
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verification">
    How to confirm the task is complete
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Clear Instructions

### Be Specific, Not Vague

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="❌ Vague">
    ```
    Fix the API
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="✅ Specific">
    ```
    Fix the /api/users endpoint that returns a 500 error 
    when the email field is missing from the request body.
    
    Expected behavior: Return a 400 error with message 
    "Email is required" when email is not provided.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Provide Necessary Context

Include information that isn't obvious from the code:

```markdown
Context:
- We use PostgreSQL for the database
- The User model is in src/models/user.py
- We follow the repository pattern for data access
- Related tests are in tests/test_user.py

Task:
Add a "last_login" timestamp field to the User model that 
updates automatically when a user authenticates.
```

### Define Acceptance Criteria

Clearly state what "done" looks like:

```markdown
Acceptance Criteria:
1. The login endpoint updates last_login on successful authentication
2. last_login is included in the user profile response
3. All existing tests continue to pass
4. New tests cover the last_login functionality
```

## Instruction Templates

### Bug Fix Template

```markdown
## Bug Description
[Describe the bug and its symptoms]

## Steps to Reproduce
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Expected vs actual result]

## Root Cause (if known)
[Any insights into what's causing the bug]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bug no longer reproduces
- [ ] Existing tests pass
- [ ] New test added to prevent regression
```

### Feature Implementation Template

```markdown
## Feature Description
[What the feature should do]

## Requirements
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

## Technical Constraints
- [Technologies to use]
- [Patterns to follow]
- [Files/areas to modify]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] Tests added
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

### Refactoring Template

```markdown
## Current State
[Describe the current implementation]

## Desired State
[Describe the target implementation]

## Scope
- Files to modify: [list files]
- Files NOT to modify: [list files]

## Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility
- No changes to public APIs
- All tests must pass

## Verification
[How to verify the refactoring is successful]
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Break Down Complex Tasks

Instead of one large instruction, use multiple smaller ones:

```markdown
Phase 1: Set up the database schema
- Add migration for new tables
- Update models

Phase 2: Implement the service layer
- Create UserService class
- Add CRUD methods

Phase 3: Add API endpoints
- Create routes
- Add request validation
- Write tests
```

### Provide Examples

When patterns matter, show examples:

```markdown
Follow the existing pattern for API handlers. For example,
see how we handle the /api/products endpoint:

```python
@app.route('/api/products', methods=['GET'])
def get_products():
    products = ProductService.get_all()
    return jsonify([p.to_dict() for p in products])
```

Implement a similar endpoint for /api/orders.
```

### Reference Documentation

Point to relevant resources:

```markdown
Implement OAuth2 authentication following the specification at:
https://oauth.net/2/

Use our existing HTTP client wrapper in src/utils/http.py
for making external requests.
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Assuming Context">
    Don't assume OpenHands knows about conventions, tools, or patterns specific to your project. Be explicit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Overloading Instructions">
    Don't combine too many unrelated tasks in one instruction. Keep tasks focused.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ambiguous Requirements">
    Avoid words like "improve," "better," or "clean up" without specific criteria.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Missing Verification">
    Always include how to verify the work is correct.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using Skills for Repeated Instructions

If you find yourself writing similar instructions repeatedly, consider creating a [Skill](/overview/skills) to encode common patterns and context.
