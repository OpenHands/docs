description: Configure OpenHands CLI settings and preferences
---

## Overview

OpenHands CLI settings are stored in `~/.openhands/settings.json` and can be configured through the interactive `/settings` command or by editing the file directly.

## Interactive Settings

Use the `/settings` command within the CLI to configure settings interactively:

```bash
openhands
# Inside the CLI:
/settings
```

### Basic Settings

The settings wizard guides you through:

- **Provider selection**: Choose your LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Model selection**: Pick the specific model to use
- **API key**: Enter your API credentials

### Advanced Settings

Advanced options include:

- **Custom models**: Configure models not in the default list
- **Memory condensation**: Toggle [context condensation](/openhands/usage/settings/llm-settings#memory-condensation) for long conversations
- **Custom base URLs**: Use alternative API endpoints

## Configuration File

Settings are stored in `~/.openhands/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "api_key": "your-api-key"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Settings Not Saving

1. Check directory permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.openhands/
   ```

2. Ensure the directory exists:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.openhands
   ```

### Invalid Configuration

If the CLI fails to start due to invalid settings:

1. Check the JSON syntax in `~/.openhands/settings.json`
2. Or delete the file to start fresh:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.openhands/settings.json
   openhands  # Will prompt for new settings
   ```
