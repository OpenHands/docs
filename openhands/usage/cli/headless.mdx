title: Headless Mode
description: Run OpenHands without UI for scripting, automation, and CI/CD pipelines
---

## Overview

Headless mode runs OpenHands without the interactive terminal UI, making it ideal for:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated scripting
- Integration with other tools
- Batch processing

```bash
openhands --headless -t "Your task here"
```

## Requirements

- Must specify a task with `--task` or `--file`

<Warning>
**Headless mode always runs in `always-approve` mode.** The agent will execute all actions without any confirmation. This cannot be changed—`--llm-approve` is not available in headless mode.
</Warning>

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Run a task in headless mode
openhands --headless -t "Write a Python script that prints hello world"

# Load task from a file
openhands --headless -f task.txt
```

## JSON Output Mode

The `--json` flag enables structured JSONL (JSON Lines) output, streaming events as they occur:

```bash
openhands --headless --json -t "Create a simple Flask app"
```

Each line is a JSON object representing an agent event:

```json
{"type": "action", "action": "write", "path": "app.py", ...}
{"type": "observation", "content": "File created successfully", ...}
{"type": "action", "action": "run", "command": "python app.py", ...}
```

### Use Cases for JSON Output

- **CI/CD pipelines**: Parse events to determine success/failure
- **Automated processing**: Feed output to other tools
- **Logging**: Capture structured logs for analysis
- **Integration**: Connect OpenHands with other systems

### Example: Capture Output to File

```bash
openhands --headless --json -t "Add unit tests" > output.jsonl
```
