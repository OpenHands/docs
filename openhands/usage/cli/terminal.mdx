## Overview

The Terminal User Interface (TUI) is the default mode when you run `openhands`. It provides a rich, interactive experience directly in your terminal.

```bash
openhands
```

## Features

- **Real-time interaction**: Type natural language tasks and receive instant feedback
- **Live status monitoring**: Watch the agent's progress as it works
- **Command interface**: Use `/commands` to manage settings, conversations, and more
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Efficient navigation and control

## Interactive Commands

While in the CLI, use these commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/settings` | Open the settings configuration menu |
| `/new` | Start a new conversation |
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/mcp` | View MCP server status |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Enter` | Send message / Confirm action |
| `Ctrl+C` | Interrupt current operation |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit the CLI |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate history |

## Starting with a Task

Start a conversation with an initial task:

```bash
# Provide a task directly
openhands -t "Create a REST API for user management"

# Load task from a file
openhands -f requirements.txt
```

## Confirmation Modes

Control how the agent requests approval for actions:

```bash
# Default: Always ask for confirmation
openhands

# Auto-approve all actions (use with caution)
openhands --always-approve

# Use LLM-based security analyzer
openhands --llm-approve
```

For more details, see [Confirmation Modes](/openhands/usage/cli/confirmation-modes).

## Resuming Conversations

Resume previous conversations:

```bash
# List recent conversations
openhands --resume

# Resume the most recent
openhands --resume --last

# Resume a specific conversation
openhands --resume abc123def456
```

For more details, see [Resume Conversations](/openhands/usage/cli/resume).
