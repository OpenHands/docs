## What is the Critic?

The critic is an LLM-based evaluator that analyzes agent actions and conversation history to predict the quality or success probability of agent decisions. It provides:

- **Quality scores**: Probability scores between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating predicted success
- **Real-time feedback**: Scores computed during agent execution, not just at completion

## Pricing

The critic feature is **free during the public beta phase** for all OpenHands LLM Provider users.

## Disabling the Critic

If you prefer not to use the critic feature, you can disable it in your settings.
