title: Confirmation Modes
description: Control how OpenHands requests approval for agent actions
---

## Overview

OpenHands provides different confirmation modes to control how the agent's actions are approved. This allows you to balance between automation convenience and security oversight.

## Available Modes

| Mode | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Always Ask | (default) | Prompt for confirmation on every action |
| Always Approve | `--always-approve` | Auto-approve all actions |
| LLM Approve | `--llm-approve` | Use LLM-based security analyzer |

## Always Ask (Default)

By default, OpenHands asks for your confirmation before executing any action:

```bash
openhands
```

In this mode:
- Every file write, command execution, or browser action requires approval
- You can review what the agent wants to do before it happens
- Safest option for sensitive operations

## Always Approve

Auto-approve all actions without prompting:

```bash
openhands --always-approve
```

In this mode:
- The agent executes actions immediately
- Faster for trusted tasks
- No human-in-the-loop oversight

<Warning>
Use `--always-approve` with caution. The agent can execute any action without your review. Only use this in trusted environments or for well-understood tasks.
</Warning>

### Use Cases

- Automated pipelines where human review isn't possible
- Repetitive tasks you've run successfully before
- Development environments with no sensitive data

## LLM Approve

Use an LLM-based security analyzer to automatically evaluate and approve actions:

```bash
openhands --llm-approve
```

In this mode:
- A secondary LLM reviews each action for safety
- Risky actions are flagged or blocked
- Provides automated oversight without full human review

### How It Works

1. Agent proposes an action (e.g., run a command)
2. Security analyzer LLM evaluates the action
3. If deemed safe, action is approved automatically
4. If risky, you may be prompted or the action is blocked

### Use Cases

- Semi-automated workflows needing some safety checks
- Environments where you want faster execution with guardrails
- When you trust the task but want an extra safety layer

## Headless Mode

In [headless mode](/openhands/usage/cli/headless), actions are auto-approved by default since there's no UI for prompts:

```bash
# Headless with auto-approve (default behavior)
openhands --headless -t "Your task"

# Headless with LLM-based approval
openhands --headless --llm-approve -t "Your task"
```

## ACP Mode

In [ACP mode](/openhands/usage/cli/ide/overview) for IDE integrations:

```bash
# Default (varies by IDE integration)
openhands acp

# With auto-approve
openhands acp --always-approve

# With LLM-based approval
openhands acp --llm-approve
```

## Choosing a Mode

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|------------------|
| Learning OpenHands | Always Ask (default) |
| Sensitive/production code | Always Ask |
| Trusted development environment | LLM Approve |
| CI/CD pipelines | Always Approve or LLM Approve |
| Automated batch processing | Always Approve |

## Command Reference

```bash
# Default - always ask
openhands

# Auto-approve all
openhands --always-approve

# LLM-based approval
openhands --llm-approve

# Headless with LLM approval
openhands --headless --llm-approve -t "Task"

# ACP with auto-approve
openhands acp --always-approve
```

## Security Considerations

### With Always Approve

- Agent has full autonomy to:
  - Create, modify, or delete files
  - Execute shell commands
  - Make network requests
  - Interact with services

- Mitigations:
  - Use in sandboxed/containerized environments
  - Limit access to sensitive directories
  - Monitor agent actions via logs

### With LLM Approve

- Secondary LLM adds a layer of review
- Not foolproof - LLM may miss some risks
- Reduces but doesn't eliminate risk

### Best Practices

1. **Start with Always Ask** until you understand OpenHands behavior
2. **Use LLM Approve** for semi-automated workflows
3. **Reserve Always Approve** for trusted, isolated environments
4. **Never use Always Approve** on production systems with sensitive data
