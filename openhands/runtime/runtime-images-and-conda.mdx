title: Runtime images and conda channel hosting
---

This page explains when OpenHands runtime builds may contact anaconda.org and how to avoid it.

Overview
- OpenHands runtime images are built with micromamba and we install Python and Poetry from the conda-forge channel
- Even when using only conda-forge, the default channel_alias expands conda-forge to https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge, which is hosted under anaconda.org

Two usage paths
1) Use prebuilt runtime images
- No conda network activity occurs during normal use; no contact with anaconda.org on your side
- If your organization must avoid any anaconda.org contact entirely, build your own runtime image instead (path 2) and configure OpenHands to use it

2) Build runtime images yourself
- As of PR #11516, you can override where the conda-forge channel resolves by setting an environment variable before building:

  export OH_CONDA_CHANNEL_ALIAS=https://repo.prefix.dev
  # then run your standard OpenHands build/run flow that triggers runtime image build

- With this set, our Dockerfile sets:
  micromamba config set channel_alias https://repo.prefix.dev

- We continue to reference -c conda-forge for packages, which will resolve under the configured host (e.g., repo.prefix.dev) instead of anaconda.org

- You can point channel_alias to:
  - A public alternative such as https://repo.prefix.dev
  - An internal corporate mirror/proxy (e.g., Artifactory) that fronts conda-forge

Notes
- We remove the defaults channel, so no packages are pulled from Anaconda's defaults repo
- However, without channel_alias, conda-forge still resolves under the anaconda.org domain by default, which is why you may see requests there
