description: Skills support across OpenHands platforms

<Note>
We are currently updating the documentation to replace the term 'Microagents' with 'Skills'. 
</Note>

Skills are specialized prompts that enhance OpenHands with domain-specific knowledge, expert guidance, and automated task handling. They provide consistent practices across projects and can be triggered automatically based on keywords or context.

## How Skills Work

Skills inject additional context and rules into the agent's behavior through:

- [General Skills/Microagents](/openhands/usage/microagents/microagents-repo): General guidelines for OpenHands about the repository.
- [Keyword-Triggered Skills/Microagents](/openhands/usage/microagents/microagents-keyword): Guidelines activated by specific keywords in prompts.
