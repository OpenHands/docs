Skills are specialized prompts that enhance OpenHands with domain-specific knowledge, expert guidance, and automated task handling. They provide consistent practices across projects and can be triggered automatically based on keywords or context.

## Official Skill Registry

The official global skill registry is maintained at [github.com/OpenHands/skills](https://github.com/OpenHands/skills). This repository contains community-shared skills that can be used by all OpenHands users. You can browse available skills, contribute your own, and learn from examples created by the community.

## How Skills Work

Skills inject additional context and rules into the agent's behavior. To customize OpenHands' behavior, create a `.openhands/skills/` directory in the root of your repository and add `<skill_name>.md` files inside.

<Note>
Loaded skills take up space in the context window.
These skills, alongside user messages, inform OpenHands about the task and the environment.

### Example Repository Structure

```
some-repository/
└── .openhands/
    └── skills/
        └── repo.md            # General guidelines
        └── trigger_this.md    # Skill triggered by specific keywords
        └── trigger_that.md    # Skill triggered by specific keywords
```

## Skill Types

Currently supported skill types:

- **[General Skills](/overview/skills/repo)**: Repository-wide guidelines and best practices. For repository-specific guidelines, you can ask OpenHands to analyze your repository and create a `repo.md` file.
- **[Keyword-Triggered Skills](/overview/skills/keyword)**: Guidelines activated by specific keywords in user prompts.
- **[Organization Skills](/overview/skills/org)**: Team or organization-wide standards.
- **[Global Skills](/overview/skills/public)**: Community-shared skills and templates.

### Skills Frontmatter Requirements

Each skill file may include frontmatter that provides additional information. In some cases, this frontmatter is required:

| Skill Type  | Required |
|-------------|----------|
| General Skills                           | No       |
| Keyword-Triggered Skills                 | Yes      |
