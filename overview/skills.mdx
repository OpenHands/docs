title: Skills (formerly Microagents)
description: Skills support across OpenHands platforms
---

Skills are specialized prompts that enhance OpenHands with domain-specific knowledge, expert guidance, and automated task handling. They provide consistent practices across projects and can be triggered automatically based on keywords or context.

## How Skills Work

Skills inject additional context and rules into the agent's behavior through:

- [General Skills](/overview/skills/repo): General guidelines for OpenHands about the repository.
- [Keyword-Triggered Skills](/overview/skills/keyword): Guidelines activated by specific keywords in prompts.
