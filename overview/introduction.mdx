🙌 Welcome to OpenHands, a [community](/overview/community) focused on AI-driven development. We'd love for you to [join us on Slack](https://dub.sh/openhands).

There are a few ways to work with OpenHands:

## OpenHands Software Agent SDK
This is a composable Python library that contains all of our agentic tech. The SDK is the engine that powers everything else below.

Define agents in code, then run them locally, or scale to 1000s of agents in the cloud

[Check out the docs](https://docs.openhands.dev/sdk) or [view the source](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/agent-sdk/)

## OpenHands CLI (a la Claude Code)
This is the easiest way to start using OpenHands. The experience will be familiar to anyone who has worked
with a CLI-based agent. You can power it with Claude, GPT, or any other LLM.

[Check out the docs](https://docs.openhands.dev/openhands/usage/run-openhands/cli-mode) or [view the source](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands-CLI)

## OpenHands Web (a la Devin)

OpenHands Web is a GUI for running agents on your laptop. It comes with a REST API and a single-page application.

[Check out the docs](https://docs.openhands.dev/openhands/usage/run-openhands/local-setup) or view the source in this repo.

## OpenHands Cloud
This is a commercial deployment of OpenHands Web, running on hosted infrastructure.

You can try it with a free $10 credit by [signing in with your GitHub account](https://app.all-hands.dev).

OpenHands Cloud comes with source-available features and integrations:
- Deeper integrations with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
- Integrations with Slack, Jira, and Linear
- Multi-user support
- RBAC and permissions
- Collaboration features (e.g., conversation sharing)
- Usage reporting
- Budgeting enforcement

## OpenHands Enterprise
Large enterprises can work with us to self-host OpenHands Cloud in their own VPC, via Kubernetes.
OpenHands Enterprise can also work with the CLI and SDK above.

OpenHands Enterprise is source-available--you can see all the source code here in the enterprise/ directory,
but you'll need to purchase a license if you want to run it for more than one month.

Enterprise contracts also come with extended support and access to our research team.
