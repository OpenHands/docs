description: Core features available across OpenHands platforms including Model Context Protocol and Skills
---

This page covers key features that are available across different OpenHands platforms, including their support levels and implementation differences.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows OpenHands to communicate with external tool servers, extending the agent's capabilities with custom tools, specialized data processing, external API access, and more. MCP is based on the open standard defined at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

### How MCP Works

When OpenHands starts, it:

1. Reads the MCP configuration
2. Connects to configured servers (SSE, SHTTP, or stdio)
3. Registers tools provided by these servers with the agent
4. Routes tool calls to appropriate MCP servers during execution

### MCP Support Matrix

| Platform | Support Level | Configuration Method | Documentation |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **CLI** | ✅ Full Support | `~/.openhands/mcp.json` file | [CLI Settings](/openhands/usage/run-openhands/cli-settings) |
| **SDK** | ✅ Full Support | Programmatic configuration | [SDK MCP Guide](/sdk/guides/mcp) |
| **Local GUI** | ✅ Full Support | Settings UI + config files | [Local Setup](/openhands/usage/run-openhands/local-setup) |
| **OpenHands Cloud** | ✅ Full Support | Cloud UI settings | [Cloud UI](/openhands/usage/cloud/cloud-ui) |

### Platform-Specific Differences

### Getting Started with MCP

- **For detailed configuration**: See [MCP Settings](/openhands/usage/settings/mcp-settings)
- **For SDK integration**: See [SDK MCP Guide](/sdk/guides/mcp)
- **For architecture details**: See [MCP Architecture](/sdk/arch/mcp)

## Skills (formerly Microagents)

Skills are specialized prompts that enhance OpenHands with domain-specific knowledge, expert guidance, and automated task handling. They provide consistent practices across projects and can be triggered automatically based on keywords or context.

### How Skills Work

Skills inject additional context and rules into the agent's behavior through:

1. **Always-active skills**: Provide general guidelines and domain knowledge
2. **Keyword-triggered skills**: Activate when specific keywords appear in prompts
3. **Context-aware skills**: Adapt behavior based on project structure and requirements

### Skills Support Matrix

| **CLI** | ✅ Full Support | `.openhands/microagents/` directory | File-based markdown | [Microagents Overview](/openhands/usage/microagents/microagents-overview) |
| **SDK** | ✅ Full Support | Programmatic `Skill` objects | Code-based configuration | [SDK Skills Guide](/sdk/guides/skill) |
| **Local GUI** | ✅ Full Support | `.openhands/microagents/` + UI | File-based with UI management | [Local Setup](/openhands/usage/run-openhands/local-setup) |
| **OpenHands Cloud** | ✅ Full Support | Cloud UI + repository integration | Managed skill library | [Cloud UI](/openhands/usage/cloud/cloud-ui) |
