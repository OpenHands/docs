title: Skills Overview (formerly Microagents)
description: Skills (formerly known as microagents) are specialized prompts that enhance OpenHands with domain-specific knowledge. They provide expert guidance, automate common tasks, and ensure consistent practices across projects.

## Skill Types

Currently OpenHands supports the following types of skills:

- [General Skills](/overview/skills/repo): General guidelines for OpenHands about the repository.
- [Keyword-Triggered Skills](/overview/skills/keyword): Guidelines activated by specific keywords in prompts.

To customize OpenHands' behavior, create a .openhands/skills/ directory in the root of your repository and
add `<skill_name>.md` files inside. For repository-specific guidelines, you can ask OpenHands to analyze your repository and create a `repo.md` file (see [General Skills](/overview/skills/repo) for details).

<Note>
Loaded skills take up space in the context window.
These skills, alongside user messages, inform OpenHands about the task and the environment.
</Note>

Example repository structure:

```
some-repository/
└── .openhands/
    └── skills/
        └── repo.md            # General guidelines
        └── trigger_this.md    # Skill triggered by specific keywords
        └── trigger_that.md    # Skill triggered by specific keywords
```

## Skills Frontmatter Requirements

Each skill file may include frontmatter that provides additional information. In some cases, this frontmatter
is required:

| Skill Type  | Required |
|-------------|----------|
| `General Skills`                           | No       |
| `Keyword-Triggered Skills`                 | Yes      |
