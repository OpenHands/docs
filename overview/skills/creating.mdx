title: Creating New Skills
description: Learn how to create reusable skills instead of repeating prompts, with best practices for structure, triggers, and content organization.
---

Instead of repeating the same prompts or instructions in every conversation, create a skill that OpenHands can load automatically when needed. Skills transform one-time prompts into reusable, maintainable knowledge that improves over time.

## Why Create Skills?

**Before (repeating yourself):**
```
Please analyze this code using our company's Python style guide:
- Use black for formatting
- Max line length 88
- Use type hints for all functions
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
...
```

**After (using a skill):**
```
Review this Python code
```

The skill triggers automatically and applies all your style guidelines consistently.

## When to Create a Skill

Create a skill when you find yourself:

- Repeating the same instructions across multiple conversations
- Working with domain-specific knowledge (company policies, API schemas, workflows)
- Using the same multi-step procedures repeatedly
- Needing consistent behavior for specific tools or frameworks
- Sharing best practices across a team

## Quick Start

### Easiest Way: Let OpenHands Help

The simplest way to create a skill is to ask OpenHands to help you:

```
Create a skill for [your use case]
```

or simply:

```
Write a new skill
```

The `skill-creator` skill will guide you through an interactive process:
- Asks questions about your use cases and requirements
- Suggests appropriate skill structure (references, scripts, assets)
- Helps you write effective trigger keywords and descriptions
- Ensures you follow best practices automatically
- Creates the complete skill structure for you

This is the recommended approach, especially when you're starting out.

### Manual Approach

If you prefer to create the skill structure manually:

1. **Create the skill directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .agents/skills/my-skill
   ```

2. **Create the SKILL.md file**:
   ```bash
   touch .agents/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
   ```

3. **Add content** (see structure and guidelines below)

4. **Test it** by using a trigger keyword in your prompt

## Determining Scope

Before writing your skill, define its scope clearly:

### Ask These Questions

1. **What specific task does this skill handle?**
   - ❌ Too broad: "Help with coding"
   - ✅ Focused: "Lint Python code using ruff with our company rules"

2. **What knowledge is required?**
   - Code style guidelines
   - API documentation
   - Domain-specific schemas
   - Multi-step procedures

3. **What resources are needed?**
   - Scripts for deterministic tasks
   - Reference documents for detailed information
   - Asset files for templates or boilerplate

4. **Who will use this skill?**
   - Just you (keep it simple)
   - Your team (add more documentation)
   - Public sharing (comprehensive examples)

### Scope Examples

**Good scope (focused):**
- "Configure pre-commit hooks for Python projects"
- "Generate financial reports using our SQL schema"
- "Deploy to our Kubernetes staging environment"

**Poor scope (too broad):**
- "Help with Python"
- "Work with databases"
- "Deploy applications"

## Choosing Name and Triggers

The skill name and trigger keywords determine when OpenHands loads your skill.

### Naming Your Skill

Choose a clear, descriptive name:

- **Use lowercase with hyphens**: `python-linting`, `k8s-deploy`, `api-docs`
- **Be specific**: `ruff-linter` not just `linter`
- **Match common terms**: Use vocabulary your users know

### Defining Triggers

Triggers are keywords that automatically activate your skill. Choose words users naturally say when they need this skill.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keyword Triggers">
    List specific words or phrases that should activate the skill:
    
    ```yaml
    ---
    name: python-linting
    description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "lint Python code", "check Python style", "run ruff", or mentions Python code quality.
    triggers:
    - lint
    - linting
    - ruff
    - code quality
    ---
    ```
    
    **Best practices:**
    - Include 2-5 trigger keywords
    - Use terms users actually say
    - Include tool names (e.g., "ruff", "pytest")
    - Include action words (e.g., "lint", "test", "deploy")
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Description-Based Triggering">
    The skill description is crucial for trigger matching. Write it in third person and include specific phrases:
    
    ```yaml
    description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "deploy to Kubernetes", "apply K8s manifests", "check pod status", or mentions kubectl commands. Provides comprehensive Kubernetes deployment workflows.
    ```
    
    **Key elements:**
    - Start with "This skill should be used when..."
    - Quote specific user phrases: "deploy to Kubernetes"
    - List concrete scenarios
    - Mention related tools or frameworks
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Examples of Good Triggers

```yaml
# API integration skill
triggers:
- stripe
- payment
- checkout
```

```yaml
# Database skill
triggers:
- bigquery
- sql query
- data warehouse
```

```yaml
# Deployment skill
triggers:
- deploy
- kubernetes
- k8s
- kubectl
```

## Defining the Skill Body

The skill body contains the instructions OpenHands will follow. Write in imperative form (command form) rather than second person.

### Basic Structure

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: This skill should be used when...
triggers:
- keyword1
- keyword2
---

# Skill Title

Brief overview of what this skill does.

## Core Instructions

Main procedures and guidelines.

## Common Patterns

Typical use cases and solutions.

## Additional Resources

(Optional) References to bundled files.
```

### Writing Style

**Use imperative/infinitive form:**
✅ "Check the configuration file"
✅ "Validate input before processing"
✅ "Run tests after deployment"

**Avoid second person:**
❌ "You should check the configuration"
❌ "You need to validate input"
❌ "You must run tests"

### Keep It Focused

**SKILL.md content:**
- Core concepts and workflows (1,500-2,000 words ideal)
- Essential procedures
- Quick reference information
- Pointers to additional resources

**What NOT to include:**
- Exhaustive API documentation (use `references/` instead)
- Detailed edge cases (use `references/` instead)
- Long examples (use `references/` instead)

## Best Practices and Tips

### Use Numbered Step Workflows

For multi-step procedures, use numbered lists:

```markdown
## Deployment Workflow

1. **Validate the configuration**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f deployment.yaml
   ```

2. **Apply to staging**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n staging
   ```

3. **Verify pod status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n staging --watch
   ```

4. **Check logs**:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f deployment/app-name -n staging
   ```
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear sequence for complex workflows
- Easy to follow and verify
- Reduces errors from skipped steps

### Add Large Files as References

Keep SKILL.md lean by moving detailed content to `references/`:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md                    # Core instructions (< 3,000 words)
└── references/
    ├── api-docs.md             # Detailed API reference
    ├── examples.md             # Comprehensive examples
    └── troubleshooting.md      # Edge cases and fixes
```

**In SKILL.md, reference these files:**

```markdown
## Additional Resources

For detailed information, see:
- **`references/api-docs.md`** - Complete API documentation
- **`references/examples.md`** - Working code examples
- **`references/troubleshooting.md`** - Common issues and solutions
```

**Benefits:**
- Keeps context window smaller when skill loads
- OpenHands reads references only when needed
- Easier to maintain and update specific sections

### Create Scripts for Predictable Steps

For tasks that are repeatedly rewritten or need deterministic behavior, create executable scripts:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/
    ├── validate_config.py
    ├── deploy.sh
    └── rollback.sh
```

**When to use scripts:**
- Same code being rewritten repeatedly
- Deterministic reliability required
- Complex parsing or validation
- Multi-step automation

**Reference scripts in SKILL.md:**

```markdown
## Validation

Run the validation script:

\`\`\`bash
python3 scripts/validate_config.py config.yaml
\`\`\`

This checks:
- YAML syntax
- Required fields
- Value constraints
```

**Benefits:**
- Token efficient (scripts can run without being read)
- Deterministic behavior
- Reusable across projects
- Can be versioned and tested

### Include Quick Reference Tables

Use tables for configuration options, command flags, or status codes:

```markdown
## Configuration Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `timeout` | 30s | Maximum wait time |
| `retries` | 3 | Number of retry attempts |
| `env` | production | Target environment |
```

### Provide Concrete Examples

Show real examples, not abstract descriptions:

```markdown
## Example Usage

Deploy the web application:

\`\`\`bash
# Build the image
docker build -t myapp:v1.0 .

# Push to registry
docker push registry.example.com/myapp:v1.0

# Update Kubernetes deployment
kubectl set image deployment/web web=registry.example.com/myapp:v1.0
\`\`\`
```

### Use Progressive Disclosure

Structure information from simple to complex:

1. **SKILL.md**: Essential workflows and core concepts
2. **references/**: Detailed patterns, advanced techniques, edge cases
3. **scripts/**: Automation for predictable tasks
4. **assets/**: Templates and boilerplate files

## Complete Example

Here's a complete skill for Python code review:

```
python-review/
├── SKILL.md
├── references/
│   ├── style-guide.md
│   └── common-issues.md
└── scripts/
    └── run-checks.sh
```

**SKILL.md:**
```markdown
---
name: python-review
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "review Python code", "check Python style", "lint Python", or requests code quality analysis. Provides comprehensive Python code review workflows.
triggers:
- python review
- code review
- lint python
- black
- ruff
---

# Python Code Review

Review Python code using company standards and best practices.

## Review Workflow

1. **Run automated checks**:
   \`\`\`bash
   scripts/run-checks.sh
   \`\`\`

2. **Review linter output** for:
   - Style violations (Black, Ruff)
   - Type errors (mypy)
   - Security issues (bandit)

3. **Check code structure**:
   - Function length (< 50 lines)
   - Complexity (< 10 cyclomatic)
   - Naming conventions

4. **Verify tests**:
   \`\`\`bash
   pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term
   \`\`\`

## Style Guidelines

- **Formatting**: Black with 88-character line limit
- **Linting**: Ruff with company config
- **Types**: Full type hints for public APIs
- **Docstrings**: Google style for all public functions

## Additional Resources

- **`references/style-guide.md`** - Complete style guide
- **`references/common-issues.md`** - Common mistakes and fixes
- **`scripts/run-checks.sh`** - Automated quality checks
```

## Testing Your Skill

After creating your skill:

1. **Verify structure**:
   ```bash
   ls .agents/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md
   ```

2. **Check frontmatter**: Ensure YAML is valid with `name`, `description`, and `triggers`

3. **Test trigger keywords**: Use a trigger word in a prompt:
   ```
   Help me lint this Python code
   ```

4. **Verify loading**: OpenHands should indicate the skill was loaded

5. **Iterate**: Improve based on actual usage

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Mistake 1: Vague triggers**
❌ `description: Helps with Python`
✅ `description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "lint Python code", "run black", or mentions Python code quality`
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mistake 2: Everything in SKILL.md**
❌ Single 10,000-word SKILL.md
✅ Focused SKILL.md (2,000 words) + references/ for details
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mistake 3: Using "you" in instructions**
❌ "You should validate the config"
✅ "Validate the config"
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mistake 4: Missing examples**
❌ Abstract descriptions only
✅ Concrete examples with actual commands
</Warning>
