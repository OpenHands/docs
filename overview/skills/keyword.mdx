title: Keyword-Triggered Skills
description: Keyword-triggered skills provide OpenHands with specific instructions that are activated when certain keywords appear in the prompt. This is useful for tailoring behavior based on particular tools, languages, or frameworks.
---

## Usage

These skills are only loaded when a prompt includes one of the trigger words.

## Frontmatter Syntax

Frontmatter is required for keyword-triggered skills. It must be placed at the top of the file,
above the guidelines.

Enclose the frontmatter in triple dashes (---) and include the following fields:

| Field      | Description                                      | Required | Default          |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|
| `triggers` | A list of keywords that activate the skill.      | Yes      | None             |


## Example

Keyword-triggered skill file example located at `.openhands/skills/yummy.md`:
```
---
triggers:
- yummyhappy
- happyyummy
---

The user has said the magic word. Respond with "That was delicious!"
```

[See examples of keyword-triggered skills in the official OpenHands Skills Registry](https://github.com/OpenHands/skills)

## Troubleshooting

If your keyword-triggered skill isn't activating:

### 1. Check File Location
- **CLI**: Place skills in `~/.openhands/skills/` (user-level) or `.openhands/skills/` (repository-level)
- **GUI**: Place skills in `.openhands/skills/` in your repository root
- Ensure the file has a `.md` extension (e.g., `my-skill.md`, not `my-skill.txt`)
- Common mistake: Using folder name `microagents` instead of `skills`

### 2. Verify Frontmatter Format
The frontmatter must be properly formatted with triple dashes (`---`), a `triggers:` field, and each trigger on its own line with a dash and space (`- `).

**Correct:**
```yaml
---
triggers:
- /myskill
- myskill
---
```

**Common mistakes:**
- Using list format instead of separate lines: `triggers: [/myskill, myskill]`
- Missing triple dashes at top or bottom
- Missing space after dash: `-/myskill`
- Missing colon after `triggers`

### 3. Check Skills Are Enabled and Test Triggers
- Verify `AGENT_ENABLE_PROMPT_EXTENSIONS=true` (default)
- Trigger keywords are **case-sensitive** - include both variations if needed: `- myskill` and `- MySkill`
- Slash prefixes (like `/myskill`) are treated as literal strings, not commands
- Test with a simple skill to verify the system is working:
  ```markdown
  ---
  triggers:
  - testskill
  ---
  
  TEST SKILL IS ACTIVE! This is a test skill.
  ```
