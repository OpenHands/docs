title: Keyword-Triggered Skills
description: Keyword-triggered skills provide OpenHands with specific instructions that are activated when certain keywords appear in the prompt. This is useful for tailoring behavior based on particular tools, languages, or frameworks.
---

## Usage

These skills are only loaded when a prompt includes one of the trigger words.

## Frontmatter Syntax

Frontmatter is required for keyword-triggered skills. It must be placed at the top of the file,
above the guidelines.

Enclose the frontmatter in triple dashes (---) and include the following fields:

| Field      | Description                                      | Required | Default          |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|
| `triggers` | A list of keywords that activate the skill.      | Yes      | None             |


## Example

Keyword-triggered skill file example located at `.openhands/skills/yummy.md`:
```
---
triggers:
- yummyhappy
- happyyummy
---

The user has said the magic word. Respond with "That was delicious!"
```

[See examples of keyword-triggered skills in the official OpenHands Skills Registry](https://github.com/OpenHands/skills)

## Troubleshooting

If your keyword-triggered skill isn't activating:

### 1. Check File Location
- **CLI**: Place skills in `~/.openhands/skills/` (user-level) or `.openhands/skills/` (repository-level)
- **GUI**: Place skills in `.openhands/skills/` in your repository root
- Ensure the file has a `.md` extension (e.g., `my-skill.md`, not `my-skill.txt`)

### 2. Verify Frontmatter Format
The frontmatter must be properly formatted:
- Enclosed in triple dashes (`---`) at the top and bottom
- `triggers:` field must be present and properly indented
- Each trigger must be on its own line starting with a dash and space (`- `)

**Correct:**
```yaml
---
triggers:
- /myskill
- myskill
---
```

**Incorrect (will not work):**
```yaml
---
triggers: [/myskill, myskill]  # Wrong: not a list format
---

# Missing opening dashes
triggers:
- /myskill
---

---
triggers:
-/myskill  # Wrong: missing space after dash
---
```

### 3. Check Skills Are Enabled
Skills are enabled by default, but verify with:
- **Environment Variable**: Ensure `AGENT_ENABLE_PROMPT_EXTENSIONS=true` (default)
- **CLI**: Skills load automatically when the CLI starts

### 4. Test Your Trigger Keywords
- Trigger keywords are case-sensitive by default
- Try including both variations if needed: `- myskill` and `- MySkill`
- Use specific, unique keywords to avoid conflicts
- Slash prefixes (like `/myskill`) are treated as literal strings, not commands

### 5. Verify File Contents
- Ensure there's content below the frontmatter (the actual skill instructions)
- Use markdown formatting for the skill content
- Test with a simple skill first to verify the system is working

### 6. Common Mistakes
- Using folder name `microagents` instead of `skills` (skills is the current name)
- Missing the triple dashes around frontmatter
- Incorrect YAML indentation
- Missing the colon after `triggers`
- Using quotes around trigger words (not required: use `- myword` not `- "myword"`)

### 7. Testing
To test if your skill is working:
1. Start a new conversation (use `/new` in CLI)
2. Type a message containing your trigger keyword
3. The skill should activate and provide the guidance in your skill file

If you're still having issues, try creating a minimal test skill:
```markdown
---
triggers:
- testskill
---

TEST SKILL IS ACTIVE! This is a test skill.
```

If this minimal skill doesn't work, check your OpenHands configuration and ensure skills are supported in your version.
