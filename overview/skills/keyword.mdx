title: Keyword-Triggered Skills (formerly Microagents)
description: Keyword-triggered skills (formerly known as microagents) provide OpenHands with specific instructions that are activated when certain keywords appear in the prompt. This is useful for tailoring behavior based on particular tools, languages, or frameworks.
---

## Usage

These skills (formerly known as microagents) are only loaded when a prompt includes one of the trigger words.

## Frontmatter Syntax

Frontmatter is required for keyword-triggered skills (formerly known as microagents). It must be placed at the top of the file,
above the guidelines.

Enclose the frontmatter in triple dashes (---) and include the following fields:

| Field      | Description                                      | Required | Default          |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|
| `triggers` | A list of keywords that activate the skill.      | Yes      | None             |
| `agent`    | The agent this skill applies to.                 | No       | 'CodeActAgent'   |


## Example

Keyword-triggered skill file example located at `.openhands/microagents/yummy.md`:
```
---
triggers:
- yummyhappy
- happyyummy
---

The user has said the magic word. Respond with "That was delicious!"
```
