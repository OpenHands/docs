title: Your First Session
description: A step-by-step guide to your first interaction with OpenHands
---

## Overview

This guide walks you through your first session with OpenHands, from starting the interface to successfully completing your first task. Whether you're using the CLI, web interface, or OpenHands Cloud, these fundamentals will help you get the most out of your experience.

## Understanding the Interface

OpenHands provides several ways to interact with the AI agent:

### Chat Panel
The main interaction area where you communicate with the agent. Here you can:
- Type natural language instructions
- Ask questions about your codebase
- Provide feedback and clarifications
- See the agent's responses and explanations

### Terminal Output
Watch the agent execute commands in real-time:
- See exactly what commands are being run
- Monitor output and error messages
- Track progress on multi-step tasks

### Code Editor (Web/Cloud)
View and monitor code changes:
- See files being created or modified
- Review changes before they're committed
- Make manual edits when needed

### Browser Tool (Web/Cloud)
For web development tasks:
- Preview applications
- Test functionality
- Verify UI changes

## Starting Your First Task

### Step 1: Prepare Your Task Description

Before starting, clearly define what you want to accomplish. Good first tasks include:
- **Adding a simple feature**: "Add a /health endpoint to my Flask API"
- **Writing tests**: "Write unit tests for the UserService class"
- **Documentation**: "Add docstrings to all functions in utils.py"
- **Bug fixes**: "Fix the TypeError in the login function"

### Step 2: Start the Session

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    ```bash
    # Navigate to your project
    cd /path/to/your/project

    # Start OpenHands with your task
    openhands -t "Add a /health endpoint that returns JSON with status: ok"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Web Interface">
    ```bash
    # Start the web interface
    openhands web

    # Open http://localhost:12000 in your browser
    ```
    Then type your task in the chat input.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cloud">
    1. Go to [app.all-hands.dev](https://app.all-hands.dev)
    2. Select your repository
    3. Type your task in the chat input
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Monitor Progress

Once you've submitted your task, the agent will:

1. **Analyze the request**: Understand what you're asking for
2. **Explore the codebase**: Look at relevant files and understand the structure
3. **Plan the approach**: Decide how to implement the solution
4. **Execute steps**: Make changes, run commands, and test the results
5. **Report completion**: Summarize what was done

<Tip>
Watch the terminal output to understand what the agent is doing. This helps you provide better guidance if needed.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Provide Feedback

During the session, you can:

- **Clarify**: If the agent asks questions, provide clear answers
- **Redirect**: If it's going in the wrong direction, explain what you want instead
- **Pause**: Press `Esc` (CLI) to pause and provide new instructions
- **Approve**: Confirm actions when prompted

## Common First-Task Examples

### Example 1: Add a REST Endpoint

```
Task: "Add a GET /users endpoint to my Express.js API that returns a list of users from the database"
```

What to expect:
- Agent reads your existing route files
- Creates the new endpoint following your patterns
- Adds necessary database queries
- Tests the endpoint if possible

### Example 2: Write Tests

```
Task: "Write comprehensive unit tests for the authentication module"
```

What to expect:
- Agent examines the authentication code
- Identifies functions to test
- Creates test file following your testing patterns
- Runs tests to verify they pass

### Example 3: Fix a Bug

```
Task: "Fix the bug where users can't upload files larger than 1MB"
```

What to expect:
- Agent searches for file upload code
- Identifies the size limit configuration
- Makes the necessary changes
- Tests the fix

### Example 4: Documentation

```
Task: "Add JSDoc comments to all exported functions in the utils folder"
```

What to expect:
- Agent lists files in the utils folder
- Reads each file and understands the functions
- Adds appropriate documentation
- Preserves existing comments

## Taking Over the Session

Sometimes you may want to take control:

### When to Take Over

- The agent is stuck in a loop
- You see a simpler solution
- You need to make a quick manual fix
- You want to run a specific command

### How to Take Over

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    Press `Esc` to pause the agent, then provide new instructions or corrections.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Web/Cloud">
    Type a new message to interrupt the agent. Be specific about what you want changed.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Tips for Successful First Sessions

### 1. Start Small
Your first task should be achievable in a few steps. Save complex refactoring for when you're familiar with the workflow.

### 2. Be Specific
Instead of "make the code better," try "refactor the handleSubmit function to use async/await instead of callbacks."

### 3. Provide Context
If there are conventions or requirements the agent should follow, mention them:
- "Use our existing error handling pattern from utils/errors.js"
- "Follow the same testing style as UserService.test.js"

### 4. Watch and Learn
Observe how the agent approaches problems. This helps you write better prompts in the future.

### 5. Don't Hesitate to Redirect
If the agent is heading in the wrong direction, interrupt early with corrections.

## What's Next?

After your first successful session:

- [Explore different running modes](/openhands/usage/cli/terminal)
- [Learn about Skills](/overview/skills) to customize agent behavior
- [Read prompting best practices](/openhands/usage/tips/prompting-best-practices)
- [Try more complex tasks](/overview/first-projects)

<Tip>
Each session teaches you something new about working with AI agents. Don't worry if your first few sessions require some back-and-forth—this is normal and helps you learn how to communicate effectively with the agent.
