            ## Summary of changes

            This PR automatically syncs code blocks in documentation with their corresponding source files from the agent-sdk repository.

            ### Changes Made
            - Updated code blocks in MDX files to match the current state of example files in agent-sdk
            - This is an automated sync performed by the `sync-docs-code-blocks` workflow
